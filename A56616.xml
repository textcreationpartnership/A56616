            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Reaſons that moved me to write this Book, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its deſign, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the beginning of it: and given Directions alſo, in their proper places, how to uſe it. I have little therefore here to adviſe the Reader of, but that I am much indebted for what I have writ, in the Second Part, about the Nature and End of this holy Sacrament, to a Treatiſe called
<pb facs="tcp:62913:3"/>
               <hi>MENSA MYSTICA:</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I refer thoſe that deſire a larger diſcourſe on that ſubject. It is poſſible that I may not only have followed the ſenſe, but uſed alſo ſome of the expreſſions, which you find there. But if I have, it is more than I know: for I have not read it of many years; nor had either that or any other Book on this Argument by me, when I compoſed theſe Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And to ſay the truth, ſince I comprehended, as I thought, what belonged to this matter; I was not willing to look into any: meerly leſt they ſhould hinder the free conceptions of my own mind; and their very words ſhould cleave
<pb facs="tcp:62913:3"/>
too much to my Imagination.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will think fit to bring the like free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind to the peruſal of what I have writ; eſpecially an heart ſeriouſly deſirous to have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion wrought in it to our Creator and Redeemer: and then neither of our pains, I preſume, will prove unprofitable. But I do not mean by Devotion, only ſome tranſient thoughts and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſing at certain ſeaſons; when we more ſolemnly addreſs our ſelves to God our Saviour: But a ſetled love to him, diſpoſing us to preſent him alway with an heart humble, pure, juſt and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb facs="tcp:62913:4"/>
which is the oblation that all our other Sacrifices are to prepare for him, and the greateſt honour that we are capable to do him. For this expreſſes the high eſteem we have of him; that above all things we ſtudy to be like him, and conform our ſelves, whatſoever it coſt us, to his holy Nature and will. This indeed glorifies him before men; and all the praiſes we can beſtow upon him without this, are but words: which we revoke and unſay again when we croſs his Commands.</p>
            <p>And for this end Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this Commemoration of the Sacrifice, which he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:62913:4"/>
to God; that we might be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby to offer up our ſelves freely and chearfully, as he did, to do and ſuffer what our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father pleaſes. For it is rank hypocriſie to commend and praiſe his obedience to the death, whilſt we will not imitate it: but follow our own humours, rather than the will of God. And that is the ſcope of this Treatiſe, to excite thoſe that read it to worſhip the Lord with holy Worſhip, that is, ſaith one of the Ancients, <hi>by purged thoughts and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, right and true opinions; compoſed paſſions and quiet affections; and by likeneſs to God in vertue, to the utmoſt
<pb facs="tcp:62913:5"/>
of our power.</hi> They are the words of <hi>Euſebius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">L. 3. <hi>Praepar. Evang. cap.</hi> 13.</note>: to which you may add theſe of <hi>Lactantius, There are two things that ought to be offered to God; a Gift and a Sacrifice: the Gift for ever, the Sacrifice for a time; and both the one and the other is incorporeal. The Gift is integrity of mind; the Sacrifice is praiſe and hymns. Therefore the moſt excellent manner of worſhipping God, is praiſe directed to him, out of the mouth of a juſt man</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:62913:5"/>
himſelf ſuch a thankful oblation to God; he will not want a reaſon why I call it, <hi>The Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> nor fail to grow in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſpiritual underſtanding. For, as the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſaith, <hi>The love of the Lord paſſeth all things for illumination:</hi>

            <p>It is the deſign therefore of this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which a deſire to quicken and promote Chriſtian Piety hath brought forth, to ſhew as briefly and plainly as I can deviſe,</p>

                  <p>For the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, to make you ſenſible of the neceſſity and weight of this Duty, there are theſe <hi>Six</hi> things to be conſidered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT we have an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for it, from our Lord and Maſter; to whoſe ſervice we were ſolemnly devoted, when we were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And leſt there ſhould be any room for ſhifting and excuſes, this Command is ſo ordered that it hath reſpect both to the Officers and Miniſters in his Church, and alſo to the People under their Care: to the former, that they might prepare this Holy Table; to the other, that they might come to pertake of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he requires his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. to <hi>do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him.</hi> Which words, it is plain refer to what our Saviour then did, who <hi>took Bread and gave thanks and brake it and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62913:9"/>
gave it unto them ſaying, this is my body which is given for you: thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> And therefore it is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>Do you take bread, give thanks, break it,</hi> and <hi>give it</hi> to all my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now if they were bound to give it, then all Chriſtians no doubt muſt be bound (though there had been nothing more ſaid) to receive, and eat it. But the more to inforce the Duty, they are requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſo to do, according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared the mind and intention of our Lord in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs (and he is the only perſon beſide S. <hi>Luke</hi> who makes mention of theſe words <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> though two other Evangeliſts mention the Inſtitution of this Sacrament.) He tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. that when our Lord had given thanks, he brake the Bread and ſaid, <hi>take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you, Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Here theſe words <hi>DO THIS</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to <hi>take, eat;</hi> which are not in S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And therefore <hi>DO THIS</hi> in his Goſpel, immediately refers, as I ſaid, to <hi>taking bread, giving thanks, breaking it, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to them.</hi> In <hi>that,</hi> the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors were more peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and none can <hi>Do this,</hi> (i. e. <hi>take
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62913:9"/>
bread, give thanks, break it,</hi> and <hi>give it</hi>) but they. But in the other, <hi>taking, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>drinking;</hi> all Chriſtians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and are bound to <hi>do this</hi> as long as the world laſts. Which appears ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the whole diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were, as he tells them <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>to ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they did eat that bread, and drink of that Cup, which the Miniſters of our Lord gave to them. As they were not to neglect their duty, in making ready this holy food, inviting the Lords people to pertake of it, offering it and giving it to them: ſo it behoved them who were called to be careful not to neglect theirs; but to come, and eat and drink, at the Table of the Lord: that by the whole action, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by both, the Lords death might be declared and ſolemnly commemorated, with Thankſgiving and Praiſe. And to make this Command appear more weighty, let me caſt in two or three conſiderations more, before I proceed any further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Lord not only gave it to the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles;</hi> but to S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, after he was added to the number. From which we may clearly gather his intention of having this duty every where perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62913:10"/>
not only by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but all others. For when he appeared to this perſon and revealed his whole mind to him, that he might be an Apoſtle and preach to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world; he left not out this precept, but gave him particular inſtructions about it. <hi>For I have received of the Lord; that which alſo I delivered to you, that the Lord Jeſus, the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. He had not this from the Apoſtles, nor was taught it by man, but Chriſt himſelf delivered it to him, as he had done to the reſt of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: that he might teach men <hi>to do this;</hi> if they had any regard to the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their deareſt Lord. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, if they have not a great reverence to it, conſidering</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is the very laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he gave before his Death. When he was parting with his Diſciples, and taking his farewel of them (till he ſhould ſee them again after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) he left this charge with them, that they ſhould do, as they had ſeen him do, juſt before he went away. Read the verſes going before thoſe now mentioned out of S. <hi>Luke (ch.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18, &amp;c.) and you will find the ſenſe of our Saviours whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62913:10"/>
                  <q>This is the laſt Supper we ſhall eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this world: I ſhall keep no more Feaſts with you, till we meet in Heaven. But I would have you meet often and Feaſt together, upon my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Body, and my Blood ſhed for you: according to the pattern which now I ſet before you. As you ſee me, take bread, give thanks, break it and give it to you, ſo do ye. This is my Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: if you have any reſpect to the words of a dying Maſter and Saviour; if you love me, and bear me in mind when I am gone from you; Do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to <hi>do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And what he ſaid to them, we are to take as ſaid to us, for</p>
               <p n="3">3. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, this is to be done till his coming again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. It is not a Temporary Command like thoſe given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but layes a perpetual obligation upon us: till Chriſt, who appeared to put away ſin by this Sacrifice of himſelf (which we commemorate) ſhall appear the ſecond time, without ſin, unto Salvation. From whence it neceſſarily follows, that not only the Apoſtles, but all the Miniſters of Chriſt to the end of the world have power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62913:11"/>
to <hi>do this:</hi> and that the people are bound to do their part, when the Miniſter hath done his. How they will excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from an open breach of our Saviours Commandment, who do not do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, I cannot imagine. There is nothing that he enjoyns with more ſolemnity, and particular care, than this Action: and therefore the ſame neceſſity lyes upon us for the performance of it, that there doth for obedience to other of his Commands. If there be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is ſuch as ſhould rather make us exceeding careful about this duty, than otherwayes. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> It is a Command whereby our Love and Affection to Chriſt Jeſus, our ever bleſſed Redeemer, is more than ordinarily tryed and proved: there being no other reaſon for performing it, but merely our reſpect to his will and pleaſure. To moſt other duties in our Religion there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature to prompt us, or to ſhew us the reaſon of them. That we ſhould be juſt, and merciful, and ſober, and grateful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we can derive from a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within our ſelves. But this duty, to which I am exciting you, is one of the things for which there is no other ground,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62913:11"/>
but his Divine Commandment and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. We have no other reaſon why we ſhould <hi>do this,</hi> but becauſe he would have us. And therefore the doing of it is a piece of pure obedience, ariſing wholly out of our reſpect and affections to him and his injunctions. It being indeed deſigned for the keeping him in Memory; his appointment of it for that purpoſe, hath added a good Reaſon to it: Which doth mightily enforce our duty, if we have any love to the Memory of ſo dear a Saviour: and deſire to perpetuate the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſo rare a Love, and make it known to all ſucceeding generations.</p>
               <p>By this it is apparent, that the thing which makes moſt men negligent of this duty, is that which if they were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Believers, ſhould make them moſt zealouſly affect it. Natural Conſcience not reproving them for not <hi>doing this,</hi> as it doth for injuſtice, cheating, lying, and ſuch like ſins, they live ſecurely in their neglect of it. And this is the very reaſon why the people known by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> have ſo little, or rather no regard to it. But if Chriſtian Faith were planted and deeply rooted in mens hearts, they would upon this very account be the more forward to do it. Becauſe it is a peculiar
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62913:12"/>
mark of a Chriſtian, a work proper to him alone: who is moved to this, not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the common light of mankind, but purely by his Religion, and Devotion to his Saviour. For there is no piece of Divine Service in which he is intereſſed ſo much as this. It is more properly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian worſhip than any other. All the world think their Religion binds them, to pray to God, to praiſe him, and give him thanks: but to acknowledge him, and render thanks to him by <hi>doing this,</hi> belongs only to Believers in Jeſus. And that was one cauſe, I make no Queſtion, that the firſt Diſciples of Chriſt made this ſo great a part of their Devotion: which is the next conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Primitive uſe and practice upon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Saviours, doth very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his intentions, and tell us the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it. They who were taught by the Apoſtles of our Lord beſt underſtood the weight of this Commandment. And truly they underſtood it ſo, that they did as conſtantly <hi>do this,</hi> as they did publickly meet together to pray, or hear; and as oft as they did eat and drink together in token of their love and friendſhip. Both which they did very frequently. In the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62913:12"/>
Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> every day; as we read. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. <hi>They continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread at home, did eat their meat with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of heart.</hi> That is, after they had daily performed their common Devotions with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Temple Service, they went to their own houſes to tender a more particular Service to our Saviour; by doing this in remembrance of him, and keeping feaſts of charity for the poor and indigent. At thoſe <hi>Meales</hi> it is manifeſt they forgot not this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7, 11. which they took to be an exact imitation of Chriſt, who after the Paſchal Supper inſtituted this Holy Sacrament. And that it accompanied other parts of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Chriſtian duties is as manifeſt from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. where you find they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſtly</hi> or unweariedly in <hi>hearing the Apoſtolical inſtructions, in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to each others neceſſities,</hi> in <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> and in <hi>Prayers.</hi> The word we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>continued ſtedfaſtly</hi>

               <p>And indeed it is part of the food which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> our Lord hath appointed for his family; and which his Stewards, as I have ſhewn you, are to provide for them and give unto them.

and joy in God our Saviour: ſo long will there be a neceſſity of <hi>Doing this;</hi> which ſerves for all theſe ends and purpoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> And did we but ſeriouſly conſider this one thing; that a principal end for which both this and the other Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted is, that <hi>by theſe outward ſigns we might expreſs our hearty conſent to the new Covenant made by Chriſt in his Blood, and ingage our ſelves to ſtand to the terms and conditions of it;</hi> we ſhould be extremely afraid to refuſe to come to this holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: becauſe that is the ſame with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be of his Religion. For he that made the New Covenant with us and is the Author of the Chriſtian Religion, hath made theſe outward Rites and Solemnities to be Inſtruments of ſtipulation: whereby they who are willing to enter into that Covenant, and be of that Religion, ſhould expreſs their agreement and ſubmiſſion to it; and openly declare that they own Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be the Lord, and will perform due obedience to every one of his Commands. Which when they have once done, they are to ſignifie their continuance and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs in that Religion, to which by theſe means they have addicted themſelves, by the repeated uſe of the ſame things. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62913:14"/>
they live as if they repented of the contract which they have made, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced our Bleſſed Saviour: who hath made the <hi>doing this</hi> to be a ſpecial teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Devotion to him and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This is a thing to be ſadly ponder'd; and might prevail much, were it laid to heart as it ought.</p>
               <p>To which if you add all the other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> and ends for which it was ordained, they would ſtill make it appear more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: if either <hi>the will of Chriſt, his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Command, the practice of all Chriſtians, our own wants, our reſpect to the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or <hi>the great Benefits</hi> we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by doing this in remembrance of him; can make us judg any thing ſo.

               <p>IF the Reader be convinced by what hath been writ, that he is as much bound to <hi>do this,</hi> as he is to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, I hope it will have a double effect upon him. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he will endeavour to quicken and ſtir up himſelf, to a ſerious and conſtant performance of this duty, by often preſſing theſe conſiderations hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he will be very deſirous to underſtand the full mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, end, and uſe of this holy Action; that ſo he may reap the profit which is therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him. He muſt ſtifle his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or elſe it will move him to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: and the more reſolved he is in that, the more ſolicitous he will be about the other. Leaving him therefore to attend to the voice of his own awakned mind; I ſhall give him no further encitements to this duty, than will ariſe from what I am now going to ſay about the Nature of it: From whence he may draw a great many Arguments, to perſwade him to be ready

under theſe nine words <hi>[Incarnation, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, Circumciſion, Appearance, Paſſion, Death, Reſurrection, Glory, Kingdom,]</hi> were wont to divide the holy Bread in the Sacrament into juſt ſo many parts: on which they impoſed thoſe nine names. Whereby they have let us know what their conceptions were of this Action; and that they thought the Breaking, giving and receiving of that Bread, was to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate and more ſtrongly imprint on their minds, the whole Hiſtory of our Lord Jeſus. Which we are not to reflect upon in an idle and ineffectual manner, but with ſuch paſſions as we feel, when we think of the ſweet converſation, the good offices, and the ſolemn departure of the deareſt Friend that we ever had. Whom no good natur'd man can ſeriouſly call to mind, without Love, Delight, Gratitude, and a great forwardneſs to fulfil his Will and Teſtament, and to follow his admired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Now that we may be made able to do ſo, in reſpect to our Lord Chriſt, he is pleaſed to ſet before us this Holy Food; which the Chriſtian Church hath always lookt upon, as a <hi>Spiritual nouriſhment,</hi> to ſtrengthen and encreaſe in us all goodneſs. And for that purpoſe we are to addreſs our

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Having ſurveyed therefore in your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62913:18"/>
thoughts the whole Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt, I ſhall proceed to ſhew you, on what you are more principally to faſten them. You muſt not conſider this holy Action only as a Feaſt in remembrance of him; but <hi>as a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are more particularly, <hi>to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate his Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Lord, the High-Prieſt of our profeſſion, was pleaſed himſelf to be offered upon the croſs; where <hi>he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us an offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour. Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. A kindneſs that, as it ought never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſo it, ought to be mentioned with the higheſt and devouteſt praiſes. And therefore after the manner of thoſe Feaſts among the Jews, and Gentiles too) in which the people had ſome portion of the Sacrifice to entertain themſelves and their friends withal; he makes us pertakers of the Sacrifice which he made to God, by admitting us in theſe repreſentations of his body and blood, to feaſt upon it. Which Action is <hi>a grateful commemoration of his death to his everlaſting praiſe and glory.</hi> Therein we ſet forth that Sacrifice of his for us; and ſignifie the thankful ſenſe we have of his love, and our high eſteem of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62913:19"/>
thoſe benefits which his bloody Death hath purchaſed to us. This we learn, <hi>firſt,</hi> from thoſe words of our <hi>Lord</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> which teach us to do this <hi>in remembrance</hi> of him. Which phraſe doth not ſignifie our calling him to mind, but our <hi>making mention of his dying love</hi> with due praiſes and acknowledgments: which is beſt expreſſed by the word <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate.</hi> We declare by doing this, that we indeed bear that remarkable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his kindneſs, in the remembrance of a thankful heart; and will endeavour to make it be remembred in the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation. That this is the meaning appears more fully from a <hi>ſecond</hi> expreſſion of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. where he ſaith as often as they did this, they <hi>ſhewed forth the Lords death, till he came.</hi> We <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>publiſh</hi> by this Action his bloody Death. We proclaim, and <hi>abundantly utter the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his great goodneſs:</hi> which he would have made known to all, by this ſolemn Feaſt, till his ſecond appearing. This is the import of that word <hi>ſhew forth:</hi> only it carries this further notion in it (as appears by the uſe of it in the <hi>Pſalms</hi>

benefits he hath obtained for us: with a deſire that they may be acknowledged in the ſame manner to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>And here now we may conſider that this Commemoration and ſhewing forth looks two ways: towards men and towards God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhew it forth and tell it to the world. We openly declare to all thoſe that ſee or know what we do, that the Son of God dyed for the Children of men: that he freely gave his body to be broken and his blood to be ſhed for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We proclaim Jeſus to be the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſins of the World: and ſhew how God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love to us, in that, while we were ſinners, he gave his only begotten Son for us that we might live through him. In this riches of his grace we make our boaſt; and glory a great deal more, than if we poſſeſſed the Treaſures of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And then we Commemorate alſo and ſhew forth his Death unto God the Father. We ſet before him this free-will Offering of Jeſus as a ſufficient Sacrifice for the ſins of the whole world. We mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his bounty in this invaluable bleſſing: and make mention of this which his Son
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62913:20"/>
hath ſuffered for us, as a compleat ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all our offences againſt him.</p>
               <p>We muſt approach therefore to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord with affectionate acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of his infinite goodneſs: extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and praiſing his merciful kindneſs in beſtowing on us ſo great a gift: profeſſing we will never forget the tender love of our Lord, who laid down his life for us: and beſeeching the Father of Mercies to receive us into his grace and favour; for the ſake of his dear Son, whoſe Death we ſhew unto him.

So much is the rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what hath been ſaid.

And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it may be rationally drawn from that diſcourſe of our Saviours with the Jews, in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel.

                     <hi>See v.</hi> 29 35.47.</note> the word and keeping the Precepts which Chriſt publiſhed in our fleſh, and ſealed with his Blood. This is honeſtly acknowledged by a Learned Perſon in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> who gives the ſenſe of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in theſe two lines. <hi>They are nouriſhed with the fleſh of Chriſt to eternal life, who keep the ſayings of Chriſt incarnate</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Carne Chriſti nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuntur in vitam aeternam qui Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Chriſti incarnati ſervant, <hi>Rigaltius</hi> in Cypr. Epiſt. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>. Which he expreſſes more largely in another place. The words of eternal life which <hi>Peter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged our Saviour had, are the Commands, ſaith he, which he gave when he was in Fleſh among men. <hi>For therefore he was made Fleſh, that in the Fleſh or Body of man, he might procure their Salvation, and form them to eternal life. Therefore the words which Chriſt ſpake in fleſh, the Goſpel of Chriſt, is the fleſh of Chriſt. Theſe words, this fleſh, this meat Chriſt would have us eat, ruminate and digeſt, that being nouriſhed thereby, we may profit to eternal life</hi>

                  </note>.

And thus Chriſt explains himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 63. where he ſaith his diſcourſe was not to be underſtood ſo groſly as the Jews apprehended it; but in a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62913:23"/>
and divine manner. His meaning was to be conceived as if he had ſaid, unleſs you really receive me, notwithſtanding my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crucified, as God ſpeaking to you in fleſh; and ſo conform your ſelves to my Doctrine, you cannot be ſaved. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this eating and drinking which now he call'd them unto, could be nothing elſe, but receiving him and his Doctrine; for the Sacrament of his Body and Blood was not yet inſtituted. But when it was; then, I make account, they who did eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of Chriſt, were to look upon it as <hi>a devout Profeſſion of that Faith in him and Obedience to him,</hi> without which we cannot inherit eternal life. We declare by this Action the intire aſſent of our minds to the Truth of all that he preached, when he was in our fleſh: and the unfeigned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of our Wills to be ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned according to it. Hence, perhaps, it was that this Action came to be called the Sacrament, which was the ancient name for our whole Religion<note n="*" place="margin">As may be ſeen in S. <hi>Cyprian Lactan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62913:24"/>
that the whole diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is to this ſenſe; when he calls the Cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſs, the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Blood of Chriſt; and the Bread which we break, the <hi>Communion</hi> of the body of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. That is, an Holy Action whereby we declare our Society and fellowſhip with Chriſt; and that we are of his Religion, in oppoſition to all others. Which we ſhall eaſily diſcern to be the Apoſtles meaning, if we take but the pains to conſider what it is that he goes about to prove in thoſe <hi>eight</hi> verſes [from <hi>v.</hi> 14. to 22.] It is nothing but this: That <hi>if they did Communicate with Chriſt in the Cup of Bleſſing and Breaking of Bread,</hi> then <hi>they muſt flee from all Idolatrous Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and not pertake in them.</hi> The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſaith he, is manifeſt to any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſon, as I take you to be. For to Communicate with him in that manner, is as much as to acknowledg Jeſus only to be the Lord; to honour and worſhip him; to profeſs that you belong to him; and to joyn your ſelves in fellowſhip with him. Which he proves, <hi>firſt,</hi> from the intention of the Feaſts upon the Jewiſh Sacrifices; of which whoſoever did eat, he thereby became of that Religion, and profeſſed to worſhip that God at whoſe Altar (which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62913:24"/>
                  <hi>Malachi</hi> calls his Table. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7.) that meat was offered in honour of him. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> from the Religious Feaſts among the Gentiles; whoſe Sacrifices being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Daemons,</hi> whoſoever did eat of them, thereby he made an acknowledgment of their Deity; and that he was one of their Servants and Worſhippers. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances carry in them this general reaſon; that the eating continually of any ones meat, ſignifies us to be of his Family; or his Friends and familiar acquaintance: and ſo this Religious eating at their Tables and of their meat, was a token and a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friendſhip and Society with God or with Daemons: and by conſequence this muſt be the meaning of our pertaking of the Table of the Lord. From which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes the Apoſtle concluds with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt force of reaſon, that all thoſe who made this profeſſion of being Members of Chriſts Body, and belonging to the Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Corporation, (<hi>v.</hi> 17.) by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Chriſts Table, and eating of his Meat; muſt have nothing to do with the Tables of Daemons. For this would be to jumble the moſt contrary and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent things together: to worſhip God, and <hi>Baal</hi> too: to be the ſervants of Chriſt, and the ſervants of the Devil. Whereas,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62913:25"/>
in truth, by honouring them in eating of their Sacrifices, they did, in effect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt. And by Communicating with Chriſt, at his Table, they did re-renounce them. For he came <hi>to deſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. and Idolatry in the firſt place: wherein that worſhip and ſervice was paid to the devil, which was due to God alone.</p>
               <p>You muſt addreſs your ſelves then to the Table of the Lord, as the friends of Jeſus Chriſt; on purpoſe to profeſs that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, and are of his Religion, and mean to cleave unto him and obey him; renouncing all other Maſters for ever.

And for that end we may come to it, that being knit ſtill faſter to him, we may have a more abundant communication of his holy ſpirit to us.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62913:26"/>
ſaid, that by pertaking of this Feaſt; we make ſuch a profeſſion of Chriſtianity and ſubjection to the Lord Jeſus, as <hi>to engage our ſelves hereby in a mutual Covenant with him.</hi> So much I told you at the beginning; that Sacraments are outward Rites and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, to expreſs our conſent to the new Covenant: and whereby we ſignifie our ſetled purpoſe, and ingage our faith, to perform the duties of Chriſtians; as ever we expect that Chriſt Jeſus ſhould be a Saviour to us. But this Sacrament of the Lords Supper is more particularly deſigned for that end: that by often doing this, we may, with repeated proteſtations of our fidelity, <hi>renew our Baptiſmal Vow and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> wherein we ſtand ingaged: and in the moſt ſacred manner addict and devote our ſelves again and again, to that Service which we promiſed, when we entred into Chriſts Religion.</p>
               <p>It is well known that <hi>eating and drinking</hi> together, was ever reputed a token of friendſhip and brotherly accord, between thoſe perſons who conſent to ſuch a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this was more notorious when there was a <hi>Feaſt</hi> made on purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this Friendſhip: For this amounted to a Covenant, and thereby they entred
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62913:27"/>
into a league, to be at peace and Unity among themſelves. Thus you read that King <hi>Abimilech</hi> and his Courtiers came to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 26.28, 29.) <hi>Let us make a Covenant with thee; that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good,</hi> &amp;c. And then it follows immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>v.</hi> 30.) that <hi>he made them a Feaſt, and they did eat and drink.</hi> That is, he entred with them, according to their deſire, into a league of love and friendſhip, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſolemn entertainment for them. But then, it is farther to be noted that, when this <hi>Feaſt</hi> was <hi>upon a Sacrifice,</hi> and they eat and drank of what had been offered to God; it was ſtill a more ſacred way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting and making compacts one with another. So when <hi>Laban</hi> deſired <hi>Jacob,</hi> in theſe words (<hi>Gen.</hi> 31.44.) <hi>come now, let us make a Covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witneſs between me and thee:</hi> we are told that this was the manner of it, <hi>v.</hi> 54. <hi>Then</hi> Jacob <hi>offered Sacrifice upon the mount, and called his Brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount:</hi> that is, they remained together in one and the ſame place, as thoſe that had now no emnity nor ſuſpition of each other (though they had been at difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62913:27"/>
after they had covenanted to be Friends, by eating all of the ſame Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. By this it is apparent, that it was then a common cuſtom among the ſeveral Nations of the Earth, to make contracts and agreements together, by eating and drinking, eſpecially upon a Sacrifice. Which continued, I might ſhew you, in after Ages among the Gentiles, as well as Jewes. But I ſhall only mention one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable inſtance, which we find in <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Curtius:</hi> who tells us, that when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed with the beauty of <hi>Roxane,</hi> that he preſently determined to make her his wife: he commanded <hi>Bread</hi> to be brought, after his Country faſhion. <hi>For ſetting Bread before them was the moſt ſacred pledg of Conjugal love among the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians; <hi>which being divided with a Sword, each party taſted of</hi>

               <p>All that need be added to this is, that there was an Oath frequently accompanied theſe holy Covenants; which could never be more ſolemnly made, than when they were in the preſence of God, at theſe Feaſts upon his Sacrifices. You have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it in the ſtories already mention'd.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62913:28"/>
                  <hi>Abimelech</hi> not only deſired to make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but ſaid <hi>let there now be an Oath betwixt us.</hi> And accordingly you read after they had feaſted, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Covenant thereby made, <hi>by ſwearing one to another,</hi> early the next morning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.31. This was a ſign they intended to continue friends; and had not made that league in a fit of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when their hearts were warm with good chear, but ſeriouſly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before Almighty God. Juſt ſo you find it in the Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban:</hi> only the Oath there went before the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and the Feaſt. And the conſequence of this diſcourſe is this: that when the Jews therefore, did eat of the Sacrifices of Thankſgiving, which was Gods meat; being offered or ſet on his Altar or Table: they did expreſs thereby that they were in Covenant with God. Their feaſting with him in that manner, was a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and friendſhip with him: and they bound themſelves to keep the whole Covenant made with their Fathers; which every time they came to his Altar, was renewed and confirmed. And this we are to conceive is the meaning likewiſe, of our eating and drinking of this Bread and of this Cup at the Table of our Lord.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62913:28"/>
Our pertaking of his Sacrifice, is an open declaration that we continue ſtedfaſt in the New Covenant, that he hath made with us, and we with him: which hereby we renew and ratify. It is an engaging of our faith again to him; that we will remain for ever in his love. A promiſe to keep friendſhip with him, by never ſwerving from that Obedience, which we have vowed to him. We paſs our words to him; that whatſoever ſervice we owe him, ſhall be punctually performed. That all the Articles of the holy Covenant, which we made with him when we were firſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his ſociety, ſhall on our part be carefully and duly obſerved. As hereby he ingages himſelf (you ſhall ſee anon) to make us pertakers of all the bleſſings of that Covenant; ſo we engage to perform the duties of it. And accordingly as we acquit our ſelves, and honeſtly ſtand to the terms of our agreement with him, and make it good; ſo we muſt expect, and no otherways, to enjoy the benefits which he hath promiſed to the faithful. If we prove not falſe in this Covenant of God, but in the uprightneſs of our heart keep cloſe to our duty; then, as ſure as we take that Bread and that Cup into our hands, as certain as we taſt them with our mouths,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62913:29"/>

And this we do not only Covenant with him to perform; but this Action looks like an Oath which we take, that we will be <hi>Chriſts faithful Souldiers and ſervants to our lives end.</hi> This is an ancient notion of the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which we now uſe to expreſs this Action by. And thus in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time they underſtood the meaning of it: for he tells us, as you heard, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans bound themſelves at their Aſſemblies, by a <hi>Sacrament</hi> (or oath) not to commit any wickedneſs. When we come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Table of the Lord, we ſwear fidelity to him, and vow that we will be ſtedfaſt in our Covenant. We take the Sacrament upon it, as we ordinarily ſpeak, that we will be true to him, and <hi>manfully fight under his banners againſt the Devil the world and the fleſh.</hi> And here I cannot but remember what <hi>Joſephus</hi>

Chriſt? Is it not a moſt terrible thing to ſwear fidelity to our Lord, by laying our hands, as it were, upon his Body and Blood; nay eating and drinking that which repreſents him to us? This lays the moſt powerful engagement on us, and binds us in the ſtrongeſt reſolutions to be conſtant, hearty and zealous in our Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith and Obedience to him: without which we draw upon our ſelves the greateſt miſchiefs imaginable.

him a witneſs of their action; his wrath was to be expected againſt the unfaithful: which they had burthened themſelves withal. And therefore ſeeing here we do in ſuch a ſacred manner vow to God that we will be at peace with him and obſerve the Laws of our bleſſed Saviour; we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that we load our ſelves with Curſes and expoſe our ſelves to the Almighty's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if we do not faithfully ſtudy to make good our word. A conſideration that ought not to deter and affright us from this holy Communion, but only make us more ſerious in it, and diligently to frequent it: if we intend to be good Chriſtians, and expect to enter into the bleſſed ſociety of our Saviour in Heaven. It ſhews us the great neceſſity of obeying <hi>this Command</hi> of our Lord; becauſe of the ſecurity we hereby give him, that all the reſt of his Commands ſhall be better obſerved; if we carefully obſerve this. For who can live always in the midſt of meditations of our Saviours Love, and not be ſenſibly moved to love him above all things? who can be ever thinking of his Obedience to the death, and yet himſelf be diſobedient? who can indure to loſe ſuch bleſſings, as he ſaith the blood of Chriſt was the price of? How is it poſſible that we ſhould continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62913:30"/>
remember him, and yet quite forget our duty to him? with what face can a man plead his Sacrifice, and not himſelf be wholly offered to him? what an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hypocriſie is it, to be continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our ſelves Chriſtians and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him to be our Lord; if we will not be governed by him, and live in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Commands? Nay more than that, what deſperate profaneneſs is it, to promiſe, Covenant and Vow to be his ſervants; and to make no Conſcience how we behave our ſelves towards our Lord and Maſter? certainly, the ſerious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Action muſt needs produce other effects, and be of mighty force to make us thoroughly good. And therefore can be neglected by none that underſtand it; but thoſe who are unwilling to be tyed to their duty: and are afraid to be ingaged to uſe their beſt diligence, to keep the Commands of Chriſt. And what ſuch perſons think of themſelves I cannot tell. It is like they put away all ſober thoughts of other matters, as they thruſt by the thoughts of this. But it is certain they are in a moſt dangerous condition. They have broken their Baptiſmal vow and Covenant: and they have no mind to repent, amend their lives, and be bound to keep it better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62913:31"/>
They do the works of their Father the Devil, and will not come and renounce them once more; becauſe, they are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that if they ſhould, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them. Were their hearts right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they would be forward to come and dedicate themſelves anew to him. And they would not out of fear of breaking theſe bonds too, refuſe to renew their Covenant with him: but in hope to be aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, make a ſincere proteſtation of their purpoſes of holy liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſuppoſe they ſhould be guilty of any failing afterward; it would only move them to make the more haſt to ſue out their pardon; and to bind themſelves more ſtrictly by renewed vows to their duty: that at laſt by the help of Gods Almighty grace, in the uſe of this and all other means, they might get the maſtery over their ſins, and perform an uniform obedience to Chriſts Commands.</p>
               <p>There is a Fable goes among the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> concerning a Lord in <hi>Provence;</hi> how that he being extremely ſick and earneſtly deſiring the bleſſed Sacrament, intreated the Prieſt, when he brought it to him, to lay it upon his Breaſt, becauſe he durſt not eat it for fear of vomiting it up. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, ſaith the <hi>Legend,</hi> his breaſt opened
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62913:31"/>
and receiving into it ſelf the Heavenly food, cloſed its mouth again. The moral of it, if we pleaſe, may be true in every one of us. Did we but come to the Holy Table with fervent deſire and great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit; did we apply our thoughts ſtrongly to meditate on our Saviours won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous love, and lay our hearts, as I may ſay, to his, to feel how full of affection it was to us, in dying for us: we could not chuſe but ſet our hearts (our Wills I mean) wide open to admit him for our Lord and Governor. Our hearts would leap for joy to entertain ſuch a gracious Maſter: and they would not eaſily open again to any thing elſe, that would rob him of our love, and oppoſe it ſelf to his Commands. We ſhould hate that which tempted us to break our faith with him. The world would ſeem little in our eyes; and we ſhould find all our inordinate affections to it languiſhing and dying; that we might live to him, who dyed for us.</p>
               <p>So S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> I remember, deſcribes the meaning and intention of this Sacrament<note n="*" place="margin">L <hi>1.</hi> de Baptiſmo cap. ult.</note>.

again, and ſo may be taught neceſſarily to keep before God and his Chriſt that Ordinance delivered by his Apoſtle in theſe words; for the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us; judging this, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and he dyed for all, that they who live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that dyed for them and roſe again. He that eateth and drinketh to the indelible memory of Chriſt Jeſus who dyed for us, and roſe again, but doth not fulfil the reaſon of that memory of the Obedience of our Lord even unto death, according to the aforeſaid inſtruction of the Apoſtle [the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at all: according to the declaration of our Lord, who ſaith, that the fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> He adds a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe; and repeats it over again in fewer words in another place (if the Book<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Let us always then have this in our mind, when we are making our ſelves ready for this holy feaſt, that we are going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62913:32"/>
our ſelves again to the obedience of Chriſt unto the death. To renew our proteſtations of friendſhip with him, and confirm the Covenant that is between us.

In ſhort, to promiſe and vow in the moſt ſacred manner, that we will henceforth live unto him and not to our ſelves: and remain his ſervants in truth and fidelity for ever. Let us ſay to him ſome ſuch words as theſe. <q>Thou O Lord haſt redeemed me by thy own moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood. I ſee the wounds thou haſt received for my ſake. I behold how thy holy fleſh was rent and torn for my ſins. O the Agonies, O the pains and ſorrows which thou haſt endured for my ſalvation! I will never willingly grieve thy heart any more. Far be it from me, to pierce thee again, by ſlighting thy Commands. I had rather die, than wound thee by my unkind unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee.

I forſwear all confederacy with thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all oppoſition to thy will and pleaſure. I vow moſt ſincerely, that I

will endeavour to live in all good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and towards all men. <hi>So help me God;</hi> as I mean to be true and faithful to thee, to my lives end.</q>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> But the Obedience of Chriſt <hi>to the death,</hi> which we here remember, puts me in mind to add another conſideration (which we are to have in this Action) that belongs to this, which I have now handled. It is ſuch a Covenant wherein we ſtand enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that <hi>by doing this, we covenant even to die for him, rather than deny him.</hi> We promiſe to be obedient to him, as he was to his Heavenly Father; ſo that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our lives to be laid down to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, we cannot honeſtly refuſe it. For as we offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, in this Commemoration of him: ſo we offer, I told you, and preſent our ſelves, our Souls and Bodies to God,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62913:33"/>
to be a lively, holy and acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto him. Now the very life of the Beaſt which was offered in Sacrifice, was given to God; its Blood being ſhed at the Altar. And therefore the compleat mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this phraſe, and of this action, of <hi>offering our ſelves to be Sacrifices</hi> to God, is this: that we part with our ſelves ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and are ſo abſolutely devoted to him; that it ſhall not be in our power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to recal this gift: no, not though we die for it. As the beaſt that was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God was no longer the owners; and the Blood, <hi>which is the life</hi> (ſaith he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) became appropriated wholly to his uſes: ſo the grant we make of our ſelves to God at his Altar is irrevocable: we are no longer our own but his, and cannot reſume our ſelves any more into our own diſpoſal: but if he will have our very life, it muſt be at his ſervice. This was one reaſon, I make no doubt, of receiving the Sacrament ſo oft in the beginning of our Religion; that they might fortifie their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolution of following Chriſt to his Croſs, and dying for the teſtimony of his Truth: to which they expected continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be called. I have the authority of an holy Martyr (S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) for it, who tells us (in his Book upon the <hi>Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62913:34"/>
that in his Church they Communicated every day: which cuſtom remained till S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> time at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Spain.</hi> One great end of it was, that they might be well appointed againſt the aſſaults of their enemies; and have courage, as good Souldiers of Chriſt Jeſus, to march after him, even unto the death. For the ſame perſon, giving an account in one of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>54.</hi> Cornelio.</note>, why he would receive to the peace of the Church certain perſons that had faln away in time of perſecution (but now bewailed their fault, and reſolved to be more conſtant hereafter:) ſaith, that he ſaw a new ſtorm ariſing, and was aſſured by divine admonitions and tokens, that a more furious conflict would be renewed. And therefore it was neceſſary to receive them into Communion again (whom he exhorts to fight valiantly and play the men) that ſo <hi>they might not be left naked and unarmed: but be ſtrengthned by the protection of Chriſts Body and Blood. For ſince the Euchariſt is deſigned for that end, that it may be a defence or ſafeguard to them that receive it, we arm thoſe with the Ammunition of the Lords fulneſs</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicae Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitatis.</note>, <hi>whom we would have to be ſafe from the adverſary. For how can we teach and provoke thoſe to pour out their blood, in the confeſſion of his name, to whom we deny
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62913:34"/>
the blood of Chriſt, when they are about to fight? Or how can we make them fit for the Cup of Martyrdom, if we do not firſt admit them, by a right of Communication, to drink the Cup of the Lord in the Church? He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fit for Martyrdom, who is not armed by the Church for the war. That heart will fail, which by receiving the Euchariſt, is not lifted up and inflamed.</hi> By which laſt words, it is clear that the minds of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were raiſed up by the Euchariſt, and had a holy zeal inkindled in them, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in ſufferings. <hi>The Prieſts who celebrated the Sacrifices of God every day</hi> (as he ſpeaks in the ſame Epiſtle) <hi>prepared Sacrifices and Victimes to be offered to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For remembring the blood of Jeſus, and being touched with a ſenſe of his love to them; they went full of heat and courage: as thoſe who had made a ſworn agreement to ſuffer death valiantly; which Chriſt underwent for their Salvation. And in his next Epiſtle but one, which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Martyrdom, he calls upon the people of <hi>Thibaris, to arm their right hand with the ſpiritual ſword,</hi> (ſpeaking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the manner in thoſe days, when they received the Euchariſt into their hand, as we do now, and not into their mouth, as the faſhion is in the preſent Church of <hi>Rome)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62913:35"/>
that they might never ſtretch it forth to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous ſacrifices:</hi> but being mindful of the <hi>Euchariſt, that hand which received the body of the Lord, might embrace him and hold him faſt; and receive hereafter the reward of coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Crowns.</hi> The like we read in his Book concerning thoſe that fell away, in a time of ſuffering: when other mens <hi>mouths ſanctified with the coeleſtial meat, after the body and blood of the Lord, refuſed to taſte the profane infections and reliques of Idols.</hi> I ſhall add no more but the words of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writer<note n="*" place="margin">de Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Chriſt: Cap. de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Dom.</note>; under his name, which are very ſignificant. <hi>When we celebrate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are admoniſhed to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and chew over and over again, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord; that his paſſion may be alway in memory; and the puniſhments of death may not terrifie the Heirs of the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: but they may feed and refreſh themſelves, with the joyful ſolemnities of a timely reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. O how excellent is this Cup! How religious is the exceſs of this Drink! by which we are divinely out of our ſelves: and forgetting the things that are behind, reach forward to thoſe that are before. And loſing the ſenſe of this world, and contemning the delights of the purpled rich man; we cleave to the Croſs, and ſuck the blood, and lay our tongues in the wounds of our Redeemer.</hi>

They were tranſported, he means, by the thoughts of Chriſts death beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thought of nothing but dying for him, if he called them to it: prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Croſs, which they carried always in their mind, before the greateſt riches and glory in the World.</p>
               <p>And with the ſame affections ſhould we be inſpired when we make the ſame Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of him: profeſſing we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than diſhonour him and his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by denying them: Vowing our very life to be expended upon his account, if there be occaſion for it. This being a <hi>Feaſt</hi> as I told you, <hi>upon a Sacrifice;</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage by doing this, that we will become a bloody Sacrifice to him, if his will be that we ſhould be offered up for his ſervice. It being a <hi>Communion,</hi> participation, or fellowſhip with him; if he will have us to pertake and have fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings; we here expreſs our ſelves to be well contented.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62913:36"/>
given to us as an honour to ſuffer with him. For a feaſt is a joyful meeting; and therefore our eating and drinking, at this feaſt, ſhews that we will not think he feeds us with gall and wormwood, when we induce any thing for his names ſake: but that he gives us the Wine of joy and gladneſs; when the ſame Cup is put into our hand, which our bleſſed Saviour drank of. This is the very height of Chriſtianity; to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pitch we ſhould earneſtly ſtrive, by all means, to arrive. Every drop of our blood ſhould be ready to be poured out, for that Religion, which Chriſt ſealed with his own. And indeed, what better uſe can we make of our life, than to give it for him, from whom we received it, and who gave his life for us? And how much better is it not to live at all, than to live with the mark and brand of cowards and fugitives, from the Prince of life and the Lord of glory? Let us ſay therefore when we come to the Table of the Lord; <q>O how much do we owe thee, moſt bleſſed Redeemer! How great is the price which thou haſt paid for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of us, miſerable ſinners! Tongue cannot expreſs it, nor thought conceive it.

to taſte of the <hi>blood</hi> of any Beaſt, that was ſlain in their Sacrifices to God: but it was to be poured out at the foot of the Altar, after ſome part of it had been ſprinkled thereon. And as for the <hi>fleſh</hi> of the Sacrifice, if it was an offering for ſin, that was to be wholly burnt alſo, and they were not allowed the leaſt portion of it, at any of their Feaſts. This is a priviledg belonging to Chriſtians alone at the Table of the Lord: where they not only eat of the Bread, which repreſents the body or fleſh of Chriſt; but drink of the Cup, which repreſents his Blood. <hi>We have an Altar</hi> (i. e. a Sacrifice) <hi>whereof they had no right to eat that ſerved the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">

We are admitted to the injoyment of more ſingular priviledges, than they were inveſted withal. As we are pertakers of a better Sacrifice, which is of greater efficacy and vertue, than any of theirs were: ſo God receives us into a nearer familiarity with himſelf; and by ſetting before us not only the body of that Sacrifice which was offered to him, but the blood alſo (which was his own proper food) plainly tells us that he intends to make us pertakers of the higheſt bleſſings;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62913:38"/>
even of his own joy and happineſs. Of which he gives us ſtrong aſſurance, in that he lets us pertake not only of the <hi>blood of the Sacrifice,</hi> in this figure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation: but of the <hi>blood of that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was offered for the ſins of the world.</hi> This bids us reſt aſſured of his abundant grace; and not doubt of our acceptance with him, to a participation of his higheſt favour. There is nothing now to hinder it, nor to make us call in queſtion his merciful kindneſs toward us. For we have ſuch a token and pledg of forgiveneſs of our ſins by this Sacrifice; as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people of God had not of the forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their offences, by the blood that was offered at Gods Altar.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62913:39"/>
not before this Conſecration. That is, they become now to us, <hi>viſible ſigns of an inward and ſpiritual grace:</hi> and do not merely figure to us the breaking of Chriſts body and the ſhedding of his blood; but are a pledg of that inward and ſpiritual grace, which they repreſent. What that grace is, we are taught in our <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> when it tells us that it is, <hi>the body and blood of Chriſt, which are verily and indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the faithful in the Lords Supper.</hi> That is, they have a real part and portion given them in the death and ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus; whoſe body was broken and blood ſhed, for remiſſion of ſins. They truly and indeed pertake of the vertue of his bloody Sacrifice; whereby he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an eternal redemption for us. This is the meaning ſure, of pertaking of his body and blood, which are here communicated. Becauſe this bread and wine do not become his body and blood, by ceaſing to be bread and wine: but by tendring them to us, as a <hi>ſpiritual grace.</hi> Their efficacy therefore and vertue by the divine favour is made ours. All the effects and benefits of his paſſion are imparted to us. In ſhort, <hi>there is nothing which the body and blood of Chriſt can be to the ſpirits of men,</hi> but by theſe tokens he exhibits it to us, and gives us
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62913:39"/>
an intereſt in it. This is <hi>ſpiritually to eat his fleſh and drink his blood;</hi> as both our Church and the ancient ſpeak. Our ſouls intertain and feaſt themſelves upon his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; being really made pertakers of whatſoever his body and blood can do for them. Which S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> meant, I ſhould think, when he ſaith that <hi>theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are the Communication of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God; and of the ſufferings of God</hi>

And thus indeed the bread and wine are changed, not by aboliſhing their ſubſtance but, by turning them to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine uſe (to which they are deputed by prayer according to Chriſts inſtitution) to tender to us the ſpiritual grace of the body and blood of our Saviour. The principal part of which grace is, remiſſion of ſin. For ſin being done away; death, the fruit of ſin, is aboliſhed: he graciouſly reſtores us to the priviledg of immortality which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62913:40"/>
we had loſt: and in order to it aſſures us he will not fail to communicate the grace of his holy ſpirit; to aſſiſt and further us in our way to everlaſting bliſs. We may be ſatisfied that he will ſend a living ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into our ſpirits, to quicken, excite, and ſtrengthen us, to do according to our Vows and ingagements: that ſo <hi>we may continue in his love, as he continued in his Fathers love, by keeping his Commandments.</hi> For this is the nature and office of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental pledges, to aſſure us of the good will of God, and of his truth in fulfilling his gracious promiſes. He ingages to be faithful to us by <hi>giving</hi> them; as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves to be faithful to him, by <hi>receiving</hi> them. God bids us believe that we ſhall <hi>be accepted in his beloved;</hi> nay, he puts us in poſſeſſion of all that which the Goſpel promiſes, and the Sacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs obtained to us: <hi>mercy, grace, and peace:</hi> remiſſion of ſin; the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and eternal life.</p>
               <p>Thus the prayer of Conſecration runs in the ancient Liturgies: into which though many things are foiſted, ſutable to the conceits of later times, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſundry expreſſions of Chriſtian devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62913:40"/>
worthy of thoſe who are called the Authors of them. <hi>Bleſs this Bread and this wine</hi> (ſaith that aſcribed to S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom) make it to be the body and blood of thy Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it may be to all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, for the waſhing of the Soul, the forgiveneſs of ſin, the communication of the Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62913:41"/>
hell may not prevail againſt it,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which words [<hi>make this Bread the Body of thy Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.] are ſo well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Service of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by the addition only of theſe two words <hi>[TO <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S]</hi> as if their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had ſtudied to prevent that groſs conceit, which now they have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="*" place="margin">Our Writers have ſhewn often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the fancy of <hi>tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that Church which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it.</note>. For the Prayer there concerning the Bread and wine is, <hi>that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to us the body and blood of thy wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God doth not make them ſo <hi>in themſelves,</hi> by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſubſtance: but <hi>unto us,</hi> by their change from the common to this Spiritual uſe. Nor doth the prayer, now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Holy Spirit to come and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them, and make them his body to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuggeſt any ſuch thing, as a change of their ſubſtance. For the ancient writers frequently ſay as much concerning the ſanctifying of the Water in Baptiſm, by the holy Spirit: and yet it remains Water ſtill, though it ſerve to the myſtical waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of ſin. So do the bread and wine remain bread and wine, after the ſanctifying of them, and their becoming the body and blood of Chriſt to us. They are both: bread and wine in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and the body and blood of Chriſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62913:41"/>
the Spiritual uſe to which they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To that uſe when once they are conſecrated, we have no regard at all to the ſubſtance of bread and wine: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the body and blood of Chriſt; which by doing this are communicated to our ſouls, in the remiſſion of ſin, the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, and eternal life. To conclude, what <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Baptiſm<note n="*" place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> in Bapt. Chriſti p. <hi>802.</hi>

Nay he himſelf immediately mentions this very thing, among others, for an example of the great benefit that may be received from common matters; when they are applied to a divine uſe. <q>This Altar, ſaith he, at which we ſtand is in its Nature but ordinary ſtone; nothing different from thoſe you tread upon: but being dedicated to God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62913:42"/>
of Chriſt.</hi> So the myſtical oyl and ſo the Wine, which are little worth before the bleſſing, after the ſanctification of the Spirit, have another kind of <hi>operation.</hi> And thus a Prieſt who the other day was a vulgar perſon, being ſeparated by bleſſing, becomes a guide, a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a teacher of piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>theſe things he doth, without any change at all in his body or form.</hi>
                  </q> By theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples any man may ſee that he thought, the bread and wine in the Sacrament become the body and blood of Chriſt; with no more change in their ſubſtance, than there is in the water with which we baptize, or in the Prieſt who miniſters there or at the Euchariſt. But that they are <hi>called</hi> the body and blood of Chriſt in regard of the Uſe to which they are ſanctified; and <hi>are</hi> his body and blood, in regard of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects which are communicated to the faithful in the uſe of them; <hi>viz. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and all other benefits of his paſſion.</hi>

               <p>Now what greater favour can we deſire at Gods hands, than to be admitted to ſuch fellowſhip with him and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt? what is there of equal power with this, to poſſeſs our hearts with the love of

Which was as much as to ſay (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> his words are<note n="*" place="margin">Mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10</note>.) <hi>we are mingled together, or aſſociated: there is one food for us all: no man intrenches on his neighbours property. But as there is one equal right to us all in this common place, ſo there is a ſeveral right to every one in the place which is peculiar and proper to himſelf.</hi> Thus our Companies and Fraternities have their Common Halls and Feaſts alſo: which were appointed for nothing elſe, but that they might the better maintain love and kindneſs, among the Brethren of the ſociety. In like manner this Divine Feaſt of our Saviours inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was attended with that of charity: in which the poor were entertained as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren together with the rich; for the continuing and promoting of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Unity, and peace among them all. Nay, this Feaſt it ſelf was deſigned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, for this purpoſe, as well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62913:45"/>
as others: that all thoſe who met at the ſame Communion, might be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſtricteſt bond of holy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; by pertaking all of one bread, and drinking of one Cup. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all pertakers of that one bread.</hi> As the bread was broken to commemorate the ſufferings of Chriſt, whoſe body was broken for our ſins: ſo it was broken alſo to be diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Communicants; in token that they were but one body: members of the ſame Chriſt, and members one of another. As it was a Feaſt, their eating at the ſame Table declared their friendſhip and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but their eating there of one and the ſame loaf (which repreſented the body of Chriſt) more effectually declared it, and ingaged the holy Brotherhood to greater Unity and intireneſs of affection. It is well obſerved by S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>

                  </note>, concerning the mixing of water together with wine in the Cup of the Lord; as the cuſtome then was. <q>Waters, ſaith he, in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſignifie many people and Nations: which we behold alſo contained in the Sacrament of the Cup.

bare us all, who likewiſe bare our ſins, we ſee the people to be underſtood by water, as the wine ſhews us the blood of Chriſt. Now when the water in the Cup is mingled with the wine, the people is made one with Chriſt: and the multitude of believers is coupled and joyned together with him in whom they believe. Which conjunction of water and wine is ſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the Cup of the Lord, that they cannot be ſeparated one from the other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in Sacrificing the Cup of the Lord, the water alone cannot be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="*" place="margin">He is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who uſed only water in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note>, no more than the wine alone. For if one offer wine alone, <hi>it begins to be the blood of Chriſt without the people:</hi> if wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, <hi>it begins to be the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt.</hi> But when both are mingled and joyned together by ſuch an union that they cannot be known one from the other, then the ſpiritual and heavenly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is perfected. It is juſt ſo likewiſe in the other part: the body of the Lord cannot be meal alone or water alone, but both muſt be made one and coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and make up one ſolid loaf. By which Sacrament alſo <hi>our people is ſhewn to be made one.</hi> That as many corns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together in one, and knead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mixed together make one loaf:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62913:46"/>
ſo in Chriſt who is the bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we may know there is one body, to which our number is joyned and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q> From which words we may clearly diſcern (that I may touch on this by the way) that he did not believe the Wine in this Sacrament was turned <hi>in ſubſtance</hi> into the blood of Chriſt, but only in <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and uſe.</hi> For it begun to be his blood, when it was offered to God, juſt as the water begun to be the people and flock of Chriſt. He uſes the ſame words of both. And therefore if we ſay he thought the wine was changed from its own nature into the very ſubſtance of Chriſts blood: we may as well ſay, he believed the water to be changed from being water, and to be made the very ſubſtance of his Church or people. In the like manner we may diſcourſe concerning the bread, which, in his opinion, is ſo made Chriſts body, that it is alſo the body of the Church. For that is repreſented, he ſaith, together with Chriſt, by the flour and water made into one Bread.</p>
               <p>But not to trouble our ſelves any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with diſputes, let us therefore when we pertake of the Table of the Lord, think, that as thereby we are made one with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62913:47"/>
Chriſt, ſo we are joyned in the cloſeſt Union one with another. And let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when we are making our ſelves ready for this heavenly Feaſt, that as we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commemorate the deareſt love of our Lord, and to profeſs our love to him: ſo to engage our ſelves to the heartieſt love towards all the members of the ſame body; to enter into a Covenant one with another (as well as with him) by eating of the ſame bread and drinking of the ſame Cup; that we will never fall out any more; much leſs hate, maligne, or do deſpite and injuries one to another: but live for ever in the peace of God; in unity and godly love. O that this holy uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were more ſeriouſly regarded and laid to heart! It would make a marvellous change in the face of Chriſts Church; if all that pertake of his Table, did cordially embrace as loving friends; and reſolve to remain in an inſeparable affection.

For he compares this loving and kind diſpoſition, free from all baſe ſelfiſhneſs and covetous deſires (which look only at their own particular profit) to the eye in our head: which when it is clear and pure, <hi>the whole body is full of light, Matth.</hi> 6.22. And therefore the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we come to the Lords Table, with this end, among other, in our aim; the better Chriſtians we ſhall grow. We ſhall preſerve this light that is in us, from growing dim: and renewing our friendſhip at this feaſt (to which the Lord invites both high and low, rich and poor) we ſhall neither deſpiſe, nor envy, nor bear ill will, nor be hard hearted one to another any more.

               <p>It is a maxim (I obſerve) among Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, that a great perſon or Governor

ſhould Feaſt or entertain but ſeldom; upon ſome ſpecial occaſions: becauſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether he ſhall procure by it <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or envy.</hi> Some may think themſelves neglected; and others think themſelves diſparaged, who are not able to give the ſame entertainment. But our Lord upon the quite contrary reaſons, invites us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his houſe and Table: becauſe he invites all, and makes no difference, upon account of mens outward eſtates; and expects nothing at all again, but that all his Gueſts would love one another, with a ſincere heart and unfeigned affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The great he would ingage not to ſcorn the meaner ſort; and the meaner ſort not to envy the great. He would oblige the rich to be merciful and liberal; and the poor to be thankful and contented. The weak in knowledge not to judg the ſtrong; and the ſtrong not to deſpiſe the weak: but all to live together as loving Brethren and members of the ſame body. That ſo, they may <hi>have the ſame care one for another. And whether one member ſuffer, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may ſuffer with it: or one member re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, all the reſt may rejoyce with it.</hi> And whatſoever differences may ariſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures them, by all that is ſacred and dear to them; that they fall not out, nor make

And therefore S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I obſerve, after he had made a paſſionate exhortation to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to put on <hi>bowels of mercies, kindneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another,</hi>

And for this very purpoſe hath our Saviour inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this holy Feaſt, that our hearts may be raiſed to <hi>Praiſe and give thanks to the Father of mercies</hi> with the devouteſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62913:50"/>
not only when we are there, but <hi>at all times and in all places.</hi> This is a thing that cannot be omitted at this feaſt, without ſpoiling the very nature of it. It is not what our Lord appointed it to be; if this be wanting. With this we begin; with this we continue; and with this we conclude this holy Action. Nay, it is <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> with prayer to God, by which the bread and wine are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may become to us the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And (to ſay no more) it is ſo much of the eſſence, as we ſpeak, or being of this Action, that it hath been the name of it for many, if not for all, Ages. We find this Sacrament called the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> in the moſt ancient writers: which would make one think this was the name belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it in the Apoſtles times. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the Cup <hi>of bleſſing,</hi> which is the very ſame with <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> For, if you obſerve it, the Evangeliſts uſe theſe words indifferently when they ſpeak of the inſtitution of this holy Feaſt. S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſay that he took the bread, <hi>and bleſſed;</hi> and he took the Cup and <hi>gave thanks.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> only ſay, he took bread and <hi>gave thanks:</hi> and the Cup in <hi>like manner.</hi> And thus
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62913:50"/>
they ſpeak alſo in another matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning common food: which will help to explain this buſineſs. S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith Chriſt looked up to Heaven, when he took the five loaves and two fiſhes to feed the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and <hi>bleſſed them, Luke</hi> 9.16. S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſay only, that looking up to Heaven <hi>he bleſſed, viz.</hi> his Father, who is in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.41. And S. <hi>Johns</hi> words are that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed them, <hi>when he had given thanks, Joh.</hi> 6.11. From whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>bleſſing</hi> and <hi>giving thanks</hi> are the very ſame in their language, or include one the other: which may be further confirmed from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that though this <hi>bleſſing</hi> or ſpeaking good of his name, and <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> be directed immediately to God: yet the Creatures for which we bleſs and thank him, pertake of the bleſſing, and become the better to us. For ſo the loaves and fiſhes were bleſſed, by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours bleſſing God. And ſo we ſay in common ſpeech, that before we eat we ſhould <hi>bleſs the Table</hi> (or thoſe good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are before us;) becauſe by thanking God for them, he grants them to our uſe, with his good will and bleſſing<note n="*" place="margin">See 1 <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

our Lord, he bleſſed the bread and wine, by giving thanks, and bleſſing God, to be to his Diſciples the divineſt bleſſings, and pledges of his ſingular love. And thus we are to conceive it is at this day: by the bleſſing and thankſgiving of him that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at this holy feaſt, to which all the people ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> and joyn their hearty conſent, thoſe creatures of bread and wine are ſanctified and bleſſed, to thoſe excellent uſes, which I have already named<note n="*" place="margin">Thence <hi>Juſtin Mart.</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore you ought to be very careful of this as a principal part of your duty here: to <hi>lift up your hearts,</hi> when the Miniſter calls upon you, <hi>unto our Lord God:</hi> and <hi>to give thanks and praiſe together with all the heavenly hoſt to the Father Almighty, who of his tender mercy gave his only Son Jeſus Chriſt to ſuffer death upon the Croſs for our redemption,</hi> &amp;c. And be ſure to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to that prayer which preſently follows in our Service (for the clearer underſtanding of the uſe to which the bread and wine are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62913:51"/>
deputed, and of the means whereby they come to be ſo: which is the divine bleſſing) <hi>That we receiving theſe thy Creatures of bread and wine, according to thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſts holy inſtitution, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his death and paſſion, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his moſt bleſſed body and blood.</hi> Nay, all the time of this holy ſolemnity, praiſe and thankſgiving are to be intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every part of the Action: to make it the more effectual to us. We cannot commemorate him, as I told you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extolling and magnifying his name, and making our acknowledgments to him. And how can we remember his making his Soul an offering for ſin; without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial thanks unto him for ſo great a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? We ought to profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, with the height of joy and gladneſs of heart. To bleſs him for the gracious Covenant into which he receives us. To vow our ſelves unto him with the moſt ſolemn thanks, that he will accept ſuch poor things as we are to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And to make a grateful mention of all the benefits, he hath beſtowed on us, and intends unto us; and to all our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren: whoſe concernments ſhould be very dear unto us, as well as our own. And truly the ancient Church were ſo much
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62913:52"/>
in love with this duty, that they gave thanks to God, for all good things; the benefits we enjoy by all his creatures: as well as for our redemption by his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Becauſe this feaſt accompanied that of Charity; in which, their bodies were fed, as in this, their Souls: and becauſe of the offerings they then made of ſome of the fruits of the Earth (as we do now of money in lieu of them) for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to God, that he was the Author of all the bleſſings which they enjoyed. But this alwayes made the principal part of their acknowledgments that God had ſent his Son into the world to ſave ſinners. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as our Church teaches us in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation juſt before the Communion) <hi>above all things we muſt give moſt humble and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, for the redemption of the world by the death and Paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt, both God and man: who did humble himſelf even to the death upon the Croſs for us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners, who lay in darkneſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlaſting life,</hi> Without which thankſgiving, to ſpeak the truth, we do not do that which Chriſt commanded, and ſo cannot hope for the bleſſing he hath promiſed. Hear S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62913:52"/>
(in ſtead of all that treat of this matter) who excellently declares the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and reaſon of this Thankſgiving,<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>25.</hi> in Matth. p. <hi>178.</hi> Edit. ſav.</note> in a Sermon of his upon Eighth chapter of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> 
                  <q>A perpetual memory, ſaith he, and thankſgiving for a good turn, is the beſt way that can be found, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and preſerve it to us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dreadful myſteries and full of Salvation, which we celebrate in every aſſembly, are called the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they are a commemoration of many benefits, and ſhew forth the principal piece of divine Providence, and diſpoſe us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to give him thanks.</hi> For if to be born of a virgin was a great wonder: what was it to be crucified, to ſhed his blood for us, and to give himſelf to us for a Feaſt and a Spiritual banquet? what ſhall we call this? where ſhall we place it? we can do no leſs than give him thanks perpetually. Let this precede both our words and works: and let us give him thanks not only for our own good things but for thoſe of others. For by this means we ſhall deſtroy envy, and bind charity faſter; and make it more genuine and of a kindly nature. For a man will not be able to envy them any more, for whom he gives thanks unto his Maſter.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62913:53"/>
And therefore the Prieſt, when this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is in hand, bids us <hi>thank God for the whole world: for what is paſt, and what is preſent, and for thoſe things that are to come.</hi> This ſets us free from the Earth and tranſlates us to Heaven: and of men makes us Angels. For they making a Quire gave thanks to God, for the good things he beſtowed on us, ſaying, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Thou wilt ſay perhaps, what are they to us? they live not upon the earth, nor are men like unto our ſelves. It is all one for that; this ſignifies very much to us. For we are taught hereby to love our fellow ſervants, ſo as to account their happineſs to be our own. Let us do ſo then; giving thanks perpetually for our own bleſſings, for others; for little, for great: or rather there are none little that come from God. And that I may paſs by other things, which are more than the ſand for multitude; what is there comparable to this diſpenſation? For that only begotten ſon of his who was more pretious to him than all things beſides, hath he given for us enemies. And not only given him; but after that gift, ſet him before us for our Table:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62913:53"/>
doing all things himſelf for us: <hi>both to give, and then to make us thankful for his gifts.</hi> For mankind being generally ungrateful, he undertakes throughout, and doth all things for us himſelf. <hi>And what he did for the Jews putting them in mind of his benefits from PLACES, and TIMES, and FEASTS; that he hath done here: from a kind of Sacrifice, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into a perpetual remembrance of the good he hath wrought for us.</hi> None la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo much that we ſhould be approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and great and ingenuous, as God who made us. And therefore he doth us good oftimes even againſt our will: and gives us many good things which we know not of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is but reaſon then that <hi>whatſoever we do in word or deed, we ſhould do all in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; giving thanks to God and the Father by him, Coloſſ.</hi> 3.17, which <hi>Theodoret</hi> refers to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>There being thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to worſhip Angels, the Apoſtle enjoyns the contrary: that they ſhould adorn their words and deeds with the memory of our Maſter Chriſt; and ſend up thanksgivings to God the Father by him, and not by Angels.</hi> To him we ſhould addreſs all our Services,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62913:54"/>
in a grateful remembrance of his love in Jeſus: and, as our Communion Book ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently expreſſes it, <hi>we ſhould give him (as we are moſt bounden) continual thanks, ſubmitting our ſelves wholly to his holy will and pleaſure, and ſtudying to ſerve him in true holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our life.</hi> But eſpecially when we go to this holy Communion, we ſhould <hi>enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praiſe:</hi> we ſhould <hi>be thankful unto him and bleſs his name.</hi> Saying, <q>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed:<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62913:55"/>Thus I am come to a concluſion of the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe; concerning the Nature, End and Uſe of this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The ſum of what hath been ſaid is this. It is an holy Feaſt in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of our Lord Chriſt, eſpecially of his Death. In which we, for our part, make a ſolemn profeſſion of his Religion; and tie our ſelves in the ſtricteſt Covenant to follow him unto the death, and to live in love and charity with all our Chriſtian Brethren. And he, for his part, makes a repreſentation of his dying love to us; and confirms the continuance of it; giving us pledges that he will make us heirs of all the bleſſings, which were the purchaſe of his body broken and blood ſhed for us. So that when the Miniſter gives the Bread and the Cup to us, we ſhould think that Chriſt by him gives us tokens and aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his continued and everlaſting love and kindneſs. And when we take, eat and drink that which he gives us, we ſhould look upon it, as expreſſing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to continue his faithful Diſciples, in hope of that eternal life, which God that cannot lie hath promiſed to us.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the whole Action is the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62913:55"/>
of a Covenant between Chriſt and us. He by giving, we by receiving, ingage our ſelves to perform our mutual promiſes. He his promiſes, of giving us pardon, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do well, and immortal bliſs. And we our promiſes of loving God with all our heart and ſoul and ſtrength: and our neighbor as our ſelves. All which we are to reflect upon, with the greateſt love to God and our Saviour; with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, bleſſing, and praiſe; and with an humble confidence that it ſhall be to us, according to his word.</p>
               <p>To promote which ends I have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded every particular Head of this diſcourſe, with a brief Meditation, which may be uſed in this manner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of them may ſerve to excite our devout affections before we go to Church; or, when we have placed our ſelves conveniently, juſt before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion begin; or while the company are making their oblations to God. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> will be proper immediately after the Conſecration; while the Miniſter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf, and giving the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other Miniſters that may be there preſent with him. The other <hi>Six,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62913:56"/>
half of them may be uſed after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bread; and the other half after we have received the Cup. Or if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a more compendious form of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein to lift up their Souls to God immediately after their receiving; they may reſerve thoſe till they retire from the Holy Table to their ſeats again: and in this manner addreſs themſelves to him juſt after the receiving of the Bread.</p>

there will be time to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your ſelves with ſundry pious thoughts and meditations; which I ſhall briefly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt unto you in the next part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; that now follows. The intention of which, I told you in the beginning, ſhould be to inſtruct you in a plain and eaſy method; how to pertake of this holy food with the greater fruit and delight alſo.</p>

               <p>HAVING ſhewn you what is the Nature and Uſe of this Feaſt; you will expect, perhaps, that I ſhould tell you, who are the perſons whom our Lord invites and calls unto it. Which is a queſtion ſo eaſy to be reſolved from what hath been ſaid, that I have aſſigned no part of this diſcourſe, for the diſcuſſing of it. <hi>If you are baptized into the name of the Lord Jeſus, and ſeriouſly believe his Religion; if you take upon your ſelves to make good that promiſe, vow and Covenant, which was made in your name, when you were baptized; if you underſtand the ends of this holy Communion (which I have named) and are willing and deſirous to perform them; if you lie not under the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church for any violation of thoſe ſacred vows, which you have made to our Saviour:</hi> You are the perſons whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

he waits for, and would gladly ſee at his Table. Nay, he will take it ill, and account it a neglect of him and of your duty, a breach of your promiſe to obey all his holy commands; if you accept not of his kindneſs in inviting you thither: becauſe this is one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as I have proved, that you ſhould do this in remembrance of him. Do not intangle your ſelves therefore in endleſs doubts and ſcruples about the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are required in thoſe that come to this Supper of the Lord: but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your hearts by this plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule. <q>Do you believe the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to be the truth of God? Do you conſent to be governed by his Laws? Do you remember, and will you ſtand to the Vow that was made in your name, when you were baptized? Are you deſirous to renew that Covenant, in the manner that I have deſcribed? Do you value his favour and grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his pretious promiſes above all earthly things? Would you pertake of this holy Communion, that you may commemorate your Saviours dying love; that you may own and acknowledg him to be your Lord; that you may devote and unite your heart unto him in ſtricter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62913:61"/>
friendſhip; that you may bind your ſelf in the bond of peace to all your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and that you may receive more of his grace and greater aſſurance of his love, as the moſt invaluable bleſſing? Then lay aſide all your fears, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly approach unto him; to render him the Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving; and to receive freſh tokens and pledges of his unchangeable good will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you. I ſhall make no more words of this matter:</q> but only add, that you may know ſufficiently by the invitation which the Miniſter makes to you at the Communion, in Chriſts name (according to the order of our Church) who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons qualified for this feaſt. And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſuch plain and pregnant words, that better cannot be deviſed for your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and ſatisfaction. They are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye that do truly and earneſtly repent you of your ſins, and are in love and charity with your neighbours; and intend to lead a new life, following the Commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy ways: draw near with faith, and take this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to your comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which that you may be able to do, I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62913:62"/>
ſhall now proceed (according to the method I have propounded) in my endeavours to put you into ſuch a temper of mind, when you are at this holy Sacrament; that you may perform all that which hath been ſaid, with more eaſe and edification alſo to your ſelves. And that I may the better raiſe thoſe affections in you, which are ſutable to this action; it will not be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you a little of the excellency and dignity of the feaſt to which you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited.</p>
               <p>To make a true Feaſt theſe four things (in the opinion of the moſt learned of all the ancient Romans) muſt conſpire and meet together.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Varro.</hi> lectis viris; lecto loco; lecto tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore; lecto appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratu.</note> 
                  <hi>Choſen and ſelect perſons,</hi> a <hi>choice and delicate place;</hi> a <hi>choiſe time and ſeaſon;</hi> and <hi>choiſe proviſion;</hi> proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the quality both of him that makes it, and of thoſe that are invited to it. Now in all theſe regards, if we reflect a while on them, this Supper of the Lord which he makes for us, will be found to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably beyond the nobleſt entertainment which the world ever ſaw.</p>
               <p>For as concerning the perſons that here meet together, they are our bleſſed Lord, the Maſter of the feaſt, and thoſe <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62913:62"/>
on his name: to whom he hath given the right, or priviledg, to become the ſons of God, Joh.</hi> 1.12. A company of ſouls that are larger than the world; <hi>heirs of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; rich in faith;</hi> as full as they can hold of love and charity towards each other, and towards all men. So that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be either more honourable or more ſweet ſociety found under heaven.</p>
               <p>Then for the place you ſee it is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of God: where we <hi>give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; and ſhew forth his ſalvation from day to day:</hi> where we <hi>pay our vows unto him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all his people; and make a joyful noiſe unto him by ſinging of his praiſes:</hi> where the Angels (as I may ſay) are wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the heavenly hoſt are glad to attend upon us: according to thoſe words of the Apoſtle (in that very chapter where he treats of this Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10.) <hi>the woman ought to have a covering on her head, becauſe of the Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the time, you ſee likewiſe it is commonly the <hi>Lords-day:</hi> on the day when he roſe from the dead, when he trampled under his feet the great enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; when the Angels not ſo gliſtering
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62913:63"/>
as he, brought news that he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed our redemption; when the hoſt of heaven was at a gaze to ſee mortal man made immortal; and reſtored to the ſtate of paradiſe again: when we have nothing elſe to do but to reſt and rejoyce; to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the works of the Lord; to give thanks unto his holy name, and triumph in his praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, for the proviſion it ſelf, I have told you already what it is: the body and blood of the Lord of life: bread that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells the Angels food: a cup of bleſſing, of which thoſe ſons of glory never taſted. To theſe our Lord calls us; nay, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and intreats us to come: that we may feaſt our ſelves on his Sacrifice of himſelf; and be filled with his love; and ſatisfie our ſelves with his joyes, and everlaſting conſolation.</p>
               <p>Now what ſoul is there that can be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loſe his ſhare in ſuch divine food? that would be ſhut out from ſuch ſociety, or abſent from ſuch a place; or deſire to ſpend his day better than in near commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with our Lord? Either men do not believe theſe things, or they do not reflect on them and lay them to their hearts: for otherwiſe there is none that reads this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62913:63"/>
writing, but will be moved to make one at this holy feaſt. But then as you cannot chuſe, if you ſeriouſly conſider, but judg it very deſirable to be admitted to it: ſo you cannot but think in what manner it becomes you to be adorned, and how you ſhould behave your ſelves in ſo great a preſence. If a mean ſubject ſhould receive a meſſage from his Prince, to come and bear him company at his own Table; would he not wonder and be aſtoniſht at the favour? would it not buſie every thought in his heart to know the cauſe? and would he not lay aſide all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that he might prepare himſelf to appear there after a decent and ſeemly faſhion? He could not be ſo ſtupid as not to ſtudy to form himſelf to a comely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: and to learn to comport himſelf with all the reverence and fear, the caution and circumſpection, that his ſoul could poſſibly be maſter of. No marvel then if we ſee good Chriſtians ſo curious and exact, ſo diligent and laborious; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of our Lord in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; to dreſs up their ſouls in the beſt manner they are able when they go to his Table; and to ſute their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the height of the ſolemnity: ſince to approach unto Majeſty, on ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62913:64"/>
with negligent thoughts and after a careleſs faſhion; is to ſlight both the greatneſs and the grace of him, who grants us the honour of his ſociety. To gratifie therefore the pious deſires and endeavours that are in any ſouls, to render themſelves fit company for our bleſſed Lord at this feaſt; I ſhall ſpend a few pages of this Book, in directing them how to demean themſelves before him, and diſpoſe their hearts to enjoy moſt ſweet and fruitful communion with him.</p>
               <p>And that I may make my diſcourſe more eaſie and affectionate withal; I ſhall take the riſe of it from one of thoſe things juſt now named. Much of the contentment of a true feaſt, conſiſts in apt and good diſcourſe; according to the old ſaying, <hi>a ſupper without diſcourſe, is a Crib and not a Table</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. And therefore the old Roman, I mention'd, gives this deſcription of the choſen perſons, of whom he would have his gueſts conſiſt; that they ſhould be ſuch as know how to ſpeak in a decent manner: and are <hi>neither talkative, nor altogether dumb</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Nec lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaces, nec omnino muti.</note>. Our Lord then making a feaſt here for us, and preſenting himſelf unto us in this broken bread, and wine poured forth: we are not to look on theſe as dumb ſigns; but as things that ſpeak moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62913:64"/>
and diſtinctly to us. Though we hear never a word with our ears, yet our minds are to conceive, when Chriſt crucified is ſet thus before our eyes, that we hear him diſcourſing to us of his Love; of the ends of his death; of all the great bleſſings that he hath bought for us; and of all thoſe things which he juſtly expects from them that profeſs themſelves his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And accordingly it becoms us, to make ſuch replies unto him, and to anſwer in our hearts with ſuch expreſſions of our affection: as may ſhew that we underſtand, and are very ſenſible what he ſays unto us. Of both theſe I ſhall treat a little: leaving it to every mans own devotion, to inlarg them, as he ſees occaſion, in his private Meditations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, when you ſee theſe ſymbols of Chriſts body and blood, think that you behold the crucified Jeſus repreſented to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> you; that you ſtand in his ſight, and are in his company, yea, and hear him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graciouſly to you, and calling you by the name of his choſen gueſts, his dear friends, and beloved Brethren. Into what a trance would it caſt you, if you really ſaw the Lord of life and glory, and heard him thus ſaluting you? How ready would you be to fall into a ſwoon of love and joy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62913:65"/>
at the very mention of theſe few words; <hi>My Brethren?</hi> And yet for ſuch he eſteems us, ſaying; <hi>I will declare thy name among my Brethren, Heb.</hi> 2.12. And ſo he called his Diſciples after he aroſe from the dead, ſaying, <hi>Go tell my Brethren that I go into</hi> Galilee, <hi>and there they ſhall ſee me, Matth.</hi> 28.10. and again, <hi>go to my Brethren and ſay unto them; I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God, Joh.</hi> 20.17. And we may well conceive that in ſuch terms of grace he receives us at this holy Feaſt: and make account we hear him ſay; <q>My Brethren, I ſent my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to call you to my houſe and bid you to my Table, which here you ſee ſpread for you. It is well done that you are come; and I take it kindly to ſee you here. The reaſon of my invitation is that I may remember you of my love, and that you may ſhew your ſelves my Friends by a joyful commemoration thereof. I have no other end in ſending for you, but to make you more ſenſible of your happineſs; and to lay obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on you, by doing my will, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it; and likewiſe to impart unto you new tokens of my love: the very greateſt pledges that I can beſtow on you, to aſſure you that I will be your
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62913:65"/>
eternal friend. You may think perhaps, that this is but a little bread and wine which here you ſee before you; and that it is but poor cheer which I have provided for you. But open the eyes of your mind; remember and believe what I have taught you; and you will ſee that this is my body which was broken for you, and this is my blood which was ſhed for you: and on theſe I would now have you feaſt together. Behold here, how the ſpear pierced my ſide. See the hole which was made by the lance when it run to my very heart. Do you not diſcern how my hands were wounded; how my feet were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when I was nailed to the Croſs for you? How deſpitefully was I uſed? how cruelly was I martyred and tormented? beſides all the mockeries and abuſes, the ſhame and reproach, the agony and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſweat which I endured to do you Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Did I not love you, think you, when I ſuffered thus for you? Can you chuſe but read the greatneſs of my affection, which is writ in my moſt pretious blood? Can you doubt that you are dear unto me, whom I have purchaſed at ſo high a rate? Let theſe wounds ſpeak for me, and tell you what a paſſion I was in for your ſake.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62913:66"/>
Look into them; and ſee what a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire I had to accompliſh your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. What ſorrow was there ever like unto my ſorrow? or what love was there ever like unto my love? This broken bread and this wine poured out, tells you that I have dyed once for you already: and I am now come by giving them to you to let you know that I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me of it; but if it were needful, I would die for you the ſecond time. What greater aſſurance can your heart wiſh of my love, than this which I now offer you? what more would you have me do, to teſtifie that my heart is ſtill towards you, and that I will he ever mindful of you? <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo I have loved you:</hi> and all that I deſire of you is that you would <hi>continue in my love. If you keep my Commandments you ſhall abide in my love:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9, 10, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>even as I have kept my Fathers Commandment and abide in his love.</hi> This is the token I would have of your kindneſs to me. <hi>Ye are my friends, if you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe do I requeſt of you, but that you would not hurt your ſelves by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt my love: that you would henceforth live unto me, who dyed for you. Come, I beſeech you now, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62913:66"/>
aſſure me, that you love me. Renew your covenant of friendſhip with me. By taking, eating and drinking this that I give you, plight me your faith that you will be ever true unto me. And then I will be your ſecurity againſt the curſe and the condemnation which you dread. I will undertake for you, that all your ſins ſhall be pardoned. Nay, I will preſent you fair and beautiful before my Father, as if you had been always innocent. Take my word for it, that I will deliver you from the wrath to come, and give you the bleſſing of eternal life. If you doubt at all of it; come hither, take this bread and drink this cup: as ſure as you now receive theſe, your ſins ſhall be blotted out and never remembred in the great day of judgment. By theſe tokens I give you an intereſt in my death and ſufferings. I oblige my ſelf by theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigns to perform all my promiſes. I ſeal to you that gracious Covenant which was made in my blood. As certainly as I dyed, I aſſure you that you ſhall live for ever. Only, as I ſaid, do not deny me your hearty love. Grant me this ſmall requeſt, to correſpond with me in ſincere affection. And by eating and drinking here at my Table, tye your ſelves to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62913:67"/>
my faithful ſervants. Then I allow you to begin now the joys of Heaven. Nay, I require you to rejoyce in my ſalvation: to comfort your ſelves in my promiſes; to ſolace your ſouls in the hope of my glory, and to ſing the Song of Angels, which ſhall end and be completed in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hallelujahs.</q> 
                  <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no dream and mere imagination, I aſſure you Chriſtian Readers, no vain fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that you entertain your ſelves withal; if you conceive our Lord thus diſcourſing to you at his Table. For all this is, in effect, pronounced by the Bread and wine which repreſent his pretious body and blood. When they are broken and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out before your eyes, and offered to you to eat and drink in commemoration of of his death: they report unto you his great love, and declare the agonies and pains which he indured, and give you aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by authority from him, that he will never ceaſe to bleſs you and do you good. And therefore you cannot better affect your hearts and raiſe your devotion to him, in my opinion, than by expounding their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your ſelves, and thinking you hear him uttering by them ſuch words unto you, as I have now mentioned.</p>

Can you find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to return to ſo kind and gracious a declaration of the bowels of his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you? Or will it be hard to tell him your heart, who hath ſo freely opened his unto you? No man ſure can be mute, unleſs he be aſtoniſht and ſtruck dumb at the power and mightineſs of his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible charity. This may indeed juſtly ſtrike us all with the greateſt admiration, and hold us a while in wondring thoughts, that we ſhould be thus beloved of God. It will well become us to be amazed and loſt in our thoughts; to be unable to do any thing at the firſt hearing of all theſe things, but only marvel that he ſhould be ſo kind to ſuch wretched ſinners. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not begin this action better, than in a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thoughts not to be expreſſed. In a ſilent admiration that the God of Heaven ſhould thus graciouſly viſit us; manifeſting himſelf in our fleſh, giving his Son to die for us, and inventing ſo many ways to make us reſt aſſured of his love towards us.</p>

You may ſay to him in your heart; O my Lord, I bluſh to ſee my ſoul ſo foul, that nothing leſs than thy pretious blood would ſerve to waſh and cleanſe it. I am confounded to ſee thee in ſuch a caſe, for us who cared not how vile and baſe and miſerable we were. What have we done, that we ſhould bring thee to a Croſs? O what wretches were we, that we ſhould underſtand the love of God no better, than to ſtand in need of ſuch an inſtance of it? with what confidence can we behold thee thus battered and bruiſed; thus wounded and bloody; thus full of pain and anguiſh as thou repreſenteſt thy ſelf unto us? I am aſham'd to think that we have expoſed thee to ſuch ignominy and ſhame. I am grieved at the heart, that we have made thee a man of ſorrows.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62913:68"/>
And our infidelity, O how great is it! that after thou waſt pleaſed to indure all this for us, we ſhould ſtand in need of ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent remonſtrances of it: and be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to forget thee or diſtruſt thee; unleſs thou didſt continually thus preſent thy ſelf unto us, and aſſure us of thy good will towards us. O my Lord, how ſhall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelf before thee! who am one of thoſe that have occaſioned all this care and pain; this agony and paſſion; this ſweat and this blood. I ſigh to remember the many groans, which we have made thy heart ake withal. It wounds my ears to hear thoſe words, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> I am ready to ask thy pardon, even that thou art come, at ſuch a rate, to pardon us. It is too much, too much, but that thou art love it ſelf, to ſpend all this love and kindneſs upon ſuch inſenſible and ungrateful ſinners.</p>
               <p>Thus having begun to make your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him, you may proceed in the ſecond place</p>

The leaſt offal of thy common mercies is too good for me; how ſhall I dare to approach to this fulneſs of heavenly bleſſings to which thou inviteſt me? I have ſinned, I have ſinned; and am not worthy to be called thy ſon, or to bear thee company. In my very beſt attire I am ſo ragged, that I am aſhamed to ſee my ſelf; and therefore how ſhall I appear before thee? O my Lord, I come merely in obedience to thy call. I ſhould not have preſumed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thy preſence, but that thou haſt hidden me. And been affraid to be

All our iniquities ſtare me in the face, as the people gazed and ſtared on thee. I ſee our deformities, by ſeeing thee thus vilely and deſpitefully uſed. It was our covetouſneſs that ſtript thee naked. Our pride that crown'd thee with thorns. Our intemperance that gave thee gall and vinegar to drink.

and ſweat. Our want of love to God, that made thee hated and rejected of men. I ſee as in a glaſs, now that I look upon thy blood, the abominable ſtate of ſinful men: which never ſeemed ſo foul as now.

For a Friend one might be content to die: but what ſhould make thee ſo in love with enemies? with the very worſt of enemies; with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; with us Gentiles who were without God in the world? Yea, with us, who now that we know the greatneſs of thy love, have ſo little or no love to thee? What am I, O Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt command me to love thee?

               <p>But when there is time to do the whole, you will not ſpend it, I hope, in any thing elſe, but ſuch Meditations as theſe. Which, that they may be diſpoſed in ſuch order as every one of them may come in its ſeaſon, you may make uſe of in this manner. Think you hear our Saviour ſpeaking to you by the Bread and the Wine; when you ſee the one broken, and the other poured out. Then you may immediately imploy your thoughts in the <hi>four</hi> firſt (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>ſecond.</hi> Meditation ſet down in the ſecond part) while the Miniſter is Communicating himſelf and others with him. The V. and the VI. will be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62913:76"/>
after you have received the Bread; and the VII. and VIII. after the Cup: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe mentioned before in the ſame place. And the two laſt in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after you have withdrawn your ſelf from the holy Table; or before, according as you can find room for them. And if your ſpirit be not able to hold out in ſo many thoughts, and expreſſions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe and affection of your heart; you may ſingle out thoſe, which you find to give you the moſt lively touch, and lift up your heart higheſt toward the Lord. And at ſome opportunity, the reſt perhaps may be as acceptable, or more welcome meditations: nay, you may feel your ſoul inlarged and run out in more pious thoughts and affections, than I can ſuggeſt or excite by all that I am able to ſay on this ſubject. But I deſire you never to omit one meditation, when you behold the reſt of the company receiving, which is; that all thoſe, and the whole Church, who pertake of this holy Communion, are your Brethren. To whom you muſt ſtir up (as I directed you before) the moſt fervent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the readieſt diſpoſition to relieve, counſel, aſſiſt, comfort, or admoniſh them; as there ſhall be occaſion: And with whom you muſt reſolve to live in the ſtricteſt Unity

and peace, as thoſe who are Members of the very ſame body. When you think therefore that our Lord tells you, there is nothing he deſires of you, but that you would <hi>continue in his love and friendſhip by keeping his Commandments,</hi> (as he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9, 10. &amp;c.) remember that he adds preſently, <hi>This is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that you love one another, as I have loved you, v.</hi> 12. which he repeats again, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another.</hi> And ſo, take them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your heart, with as much affection; as if the embracing each other in our arms, and giving the holy kiſs of charity, were ſtill in uſe among us.

               <p>BY this time, I hope, you ſee, that <hi>it is good for you to draw near to God,</hi> at his holy Table: if you have any deſire to be good Chriſtians, or any ſavour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pleaſures. You muſt wholly caſt away all remembrance of your duty, and be loſt to all ſenſe of rational ſatisfaction, or elſe be ſtrongly inclined (conſidering what hath been ſaid) to take the pains to prepare your ſelves, or rather to keep your ſelves in a conſtant preparation, for frequent Communion there with our bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour. An innocent, holy, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life cannot but commend it ſelf to you, if it be but on this ſcore, that you may be intertained with ſuch a comfort, as to know the love of God in Chriſt to you; and be fit to be feaſted continually with ſuch delightful pledges of it. How is it poſſible for any conſiderate perſons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or neglect ſuch means of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62913:85"/>
The Table of the Lord, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, ſhould be more acceptable to them than a ſtage; and they ſhould run more greedily to this Divine feaſt than they do to the Theatres. He ſhould have more gueſts and a greater croud to attend upon him, than thoſe ſo much frequented places. For what do they ſee repreſented there, but ſome of the follies of mankind; the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and misfortunes of a miſerable lover; the wiles and ſubtle contrivances of ſome ingenious perſon; or ſuch like things, ſome of which never were? But here is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the great wiſdom of Almighty God; the manifold wiſdom of our Creator, into which the Angels deſired to look, and of which they are gladſome ſpectators: The incomparable kindneſs of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; that ardent love which offered him up to God upon the Croſs, and which he ſtill continues now that he is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; as we ſee by theſe remembrances which he hath left us of it: The rare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Salvation: the wonderful way which Heaven hath contrived to bring loſt ſouls again thither: the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which the Saviour of the world, hath made over ſin, the grave and Hell: All which we here behold his Captives, and our ſelves the prize which he deſires to win
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62913:85"/>
by all his labours. Do not men then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly betray their infidelity; is it not plain that Chriſtian piety lies languiſhing and dying; when ſuch numbers will ſpend a great deal of time to prepare and dreſs themſelves to be ſeen in the Theatre, and we cannot prevail, in ſome places, with any conſiderable company to meet us at this glorious repreſentation, which we make at the Table of the Lord? They that will be at the pains to go to the former every day, content themſelves, nay think it a great trouble, to put their ſouls in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to come to this holy place once in a whole year. And God knows how many there are, that will not put themſelves to that pains neither: who rarely appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God at this holy Solemnity, and whoſe faces are ſcarce ever ſeen in the preſence of our Saviour. O ſhameful ingratitude! which you that read theſe things, if you are believers, can never endure, I ſhould think, to be guilty of. If you give any credit to this hiſtory of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, recorded in the Goſpel, you will ſpend ſome time ſure to diſpoſe your ſelves to make frequent acknowledgments to him, by receiving theſe holy Myſteries. You will be aſhamed that ſo much time ſhould be conſumed in trimming up your
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62913:86"/>
ſelves to ſee and to be ſeen in other places; and little or none that you may come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and behold the great things that he hath done for your ſouls. For the love of God conſider, at what charge he hath furniſhed this Table for you: how often he hath invited you to it: how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous he is that you would ſhew him ſo much love, as not to refuſe him your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there. Think how ill he muſt needs take it, if you will not accept of his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar kindneſs; nay, that you your ſelves will not be pleaſed, when you reflect and conſider, of how much joy you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived your ſouls, by denying him ſo much of your duty. For there is no compare between all the jollities in the world, and this one ſingle pleaſure: of giving hearty thanks to God, for his unſpeakable mercy to us in Chriſt Jeſus. Do but come, and ſee. Satisfie your ſelves by waiting on him at his Table, with ſuch thoughts as become his preſence. If you have the leaſt ſpark of goodneſs; you will find it ſhine and glow, and ſpread it ſelf, to your infinite joy and contentment of heart. Among all the various degrees and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtian people, there will none be found that come hither, with ſincere affection to do this in remembrance of their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62913:86"/>
Saviour, but may go away rejoycing, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many divine benefits.</p>
               <p>For we may apply to this heavenly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment what the Jews ſay of their <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> ſent down by God from Heaven to them; which contained in it (as their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition affirms) all the taſts that any man deſired and longed for: it being ſo ſuted to every pallate and conſtitution, that none could fail to be both fed and pleaſed; though they were of never ſo different tempers. This is not only a common ſtory in the Books of the later Hebrew Doctors, but we meet with it in one of the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal writings, which is very ancient. <hi>Thou feddeſt thine own people with Angels food</hi> (ſaith the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> chap. 16. 20, 21.) <hi>and didſt ſend them from Heaven bread prepared without their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, able to content every mans delight, and agreeing to every taſte. For thy ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance declared thy ſweetneſs to thy children, and ſerving to the appetite of the eater, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered it ſelf to every mans liking.</hi> And in the great Comment upon <hi>Exodus</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove it thus. It is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. <q>
                     <hi>behold, I rain bread from Heaven for you,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>the taſte of it was like wafers made with honey,</hi> and Numb. 11.8.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62913:87"/>
                     <hi>the taſte of it was as the taſte of freſh oyl.</hi> How can all theſe agree, that it ſhould be like bread, and like honey, and like oyl? The anſwer is, the young men taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it bread, the old men honey, and the infants oyl.</q> Accommodate this now to that divine food which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath ordered to be prepared for us, and you will find it true; that he hath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared therein his ſweetneſs to his children,</hi> by making it ſutable to every complexion of mind and temper of Spirit: who may meet with what is agreeable to their wants, and will give content to their deſires. The infant Chriſtians are hereby marvellouſly cheriſhed and incouraged: it pours on them the oyl of joy and gladneſs, and ſets them forward in the wayes of God by the ſweetneſs of its pleaſures. It gives ſtrength and power to the young men, and is the bread of life unto them: that they may <hi>overcome the wicked one</hi> (as S. <hi>John</hi> writes to them 1.2.14.) and never yield to the temptations of the world, the fleſh and the Devil. And to the Fathers or more aged Chriſtians, to thoſe who have had long experience of the Service of God; it gives a ſingular relliſh alſo: and makes them ſay, that his Commandments are ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the honey and the honey comb;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62913:87"/>
and that in keeping of them there is great reward. Their hopes of immortal bliſs are hereby exceedingly advanced, and they receive the foretaſtes of it; as the Iſraelites did of the land flowing with milk and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For therefore, the Hebrews ſay well, the Manna had the taſte of honey, that it might be a repreſentation and earneſt of that pleaſant countrey to which they were going, and which was ſo deſcribed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to them. Young and old, weak and ſtrong, if they do but in ſuch a manner, as hath been now directed, <hi>feed on Chriſt in their hearts with Thanksgiving,</hi> (as the Miniſter of this Sacrament exhorts them) will feel all the graces of Gods holy Spirit plentifully nouriſhed and increaſed in them, to their great ſatisfaction. Their Faith, their Hope, their Charity, both their love to God and to their Brethren; will all be raiſed to an higher pitch. From every one of which, it would be eaſy to ſhew, there muſt needs flow abundance of divine joy, and the laſt of them will be an eternal ſpring of pleaſure. If a man had only an aſſured confidence wrought in him, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty wiſdom and goodneſs will take a fatherly care of him, and provide for him as long as he lives; what a ſatisfaction would it give to his heart? in what peace,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62913:88"/>
freedom and contentment would he enjoy himſelf? now no man can underſtand what he doth at this holy Communion, and doubt of this. If God hath given us his Son, as here we profeſs to believe; we may well conclude, <hi>how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> If he give us this holy bread, the bread of life; will he not give us the common bread of every day? will he invite us to ſuch a rich, ſuch an heavenly feaſt, and not beſtow on us our ordinary food? will not he that at ſo vaſt a price hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us this ſpiritual cheer, give us that which is ſo cheap, that every Raven, every Crow and Cormorant hath plenty of it? I can never queſtion this, will every pious ſoul ſay. I will never in the leaſt diſtruſt his tender care and providence more. Our heavenly Father knows that we have need of all theſe things: and will not deny them to us.</p>
               <p>By this you may judg how much ſtrength and life every other part of divine Faith may derive from hence: and with what joyes likewiſe the hearts of true Believers offer up themſelves in love to God; and wait for the conſummation of his love at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, when they ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:62913:88"/>But it is not the buſineſs of this treatiſe to demonſtrate theſe things, which you may find done in other Books. I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence that this is a great reaſon why many that have ſome good deſires, ſome good purpoſes at certain ſeaſons; yea, begin to do well; remain ſo weak and feeble, ſo languiſhing and dull in their devotion, nay, grow cold and indifferent again; becauſe they do not come to this holy feaſt, that they may cheriſh, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confirm what God hath wrought in their hearts. They are eaſily overcome and drawn away by the flatteries and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temptations from abroad; and ſo bring a reproach upon the wayes of God, breed an ill opinion of them in themſelves and others, perſwade themſelves they cannot do better, but that there is a neceſſity of ſinning: becauſe they will not uſe the means which God hath appointed for the ſtrengthning their inward ſenſe of ſpiritual things; or becauſe they will not frequently uſe them, when they are invited and have opportunity to come to the Table of the Lord. This would mightily quicken and enliven them; it would bind and tye them faſt to their duty; it would make it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to them to do the will of God; it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62913:89"/>
would ingage the power from above to come to their aſſiſtance; and being full of faith and love, no temptation in the world would be able to enter when it made its aſſaults. The Devil himſelf would flee away from them: according to that of S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>Peter, Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee away from you. Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And here I might repreſent the ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe ſouls that perfectly imitate the ſtupid Iſraelites; who preferred the Onions, the Garlick and the Cucumbers, before the heavenly Manna; even after they had taſted of it. That had rather, I mean, enjoy the delights of ſenſe, than theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pleaſures; and after they have been at this feaſt, call it (as they did Manna,) <hi>light bread;</hi> a thing which hath no ſolid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it. Which can be imputed to nothing elſe, but a careleſs, negligent and ſuperficial uſe of this holy nouriſhment. They do not excite their appetite and ſtir up their deſire; they do not employ their Faith, and raiſe their hearts to a due eſteem of the divine benefits; or having taſted how gracious the Lord is, they do not often reflect upon his goodneſs, and remind themſelves of their promiſes and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62913:89"/>
their hopes. For otherwiſe they would increaſe in knowledge and judgment, and grow ſtrong in the grace of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and be furniſhed to every good word and work. They do with this as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith many do with the Goſpel: who <hi>like a man that beholds his natural face in a glaſs,</hi> and taking but a ſhort glance of himſelf, <hi>goes away and ſtraightway forgets what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man he was.</hi> Whereas if he would not only <hi>look into the perfect Law of liberty, but continue</hi> to look <hi>therein;</hi> being not a <hi>forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work:</hi> he would <hi>be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> Jam. 1.23. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is the deſign therefore of this laſt part of my diſcourſe, to furniſh you with ſome apt matter for your Meditation, and with ſutable Prayers: whereby you may both quicken your ſelves, in your private clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, when you are preparing to go to the Table of the Lord; and likewiſe preſerve alive thoſe godly affections and reſolutions which are excited there, after you are come home again. That ſo by continuing to look upon what you have done, and what your Saviour hath done unto you; and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in a clear Mirror the great love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and your great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him; you may never forget him,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62913:90"/>
nor the duty you owe him, but be bleſſed in a faithful obſervance of both.</p>
               <p>And that no man may have the excuſe which the wanton Iſraelites pretended, who were cloyed with the ſame thing, repeated over and over again; I have taken the pains to compoſe variety of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Prayers (ſome longer, ſome ſhorter;) for every Month in the year, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Feſtivals in remembrance of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Which you may either make uſe of, if your infirmity require it; or elſe ſtick conſtantly to ſuch as you like beſt, and find moſt apt to move your hearts. No mans thoughts are alwayes alike, neither his that writes, nor his that reads; and therefore ſometimes one may be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to you, ſometimes another: but there will be no time, I hope, wherein you may not be able, among them all, to fit your ſelf with a Meditation and a Prayer, that may ſtir up and further your Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards God. And he that will be at ſo much pains with himſelf, as to follow ſome ſuch method as this, will never be able to ſay hereafter, as too many wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls have done; that they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented this holy Sacrament, but were never the better for it.</p>

                     <p>COnſider with your ſelf, ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you intend to Communicate, that you are invited to come, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence but, unto the Table of God: to be one of the gueſts of the Lord of the whole world. What a grace; what an honour is this? Shall any buſineſs, any pleaſure on earth put by the thoughts of it? It is impoſſible, if you remember what the great God is who calls you to him; and that he ſets the body of his Son before you upon your Table; and that your Cup is filled with his Blood: That the Angels think it not below them to waite on you and miniſter to you; and the divine Spirit will be ready to breath upon you, and fill you with ſuch holy love, that you ſhall ſend up your ſoul in joyful hymns of Praiſe and Thanks to God our Saviour. With what admiration ſhould you receive the news of this invitation? With what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ought you to approach him? With what forwardneſs of love; with what gladneſs of heart ſhould you go to meet
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62913:91"/>
our bleſſed Lord? Was there ever any kindneſs (ſhould you think with your ſelves) like unto that of his? Did there ever ſuch a furnace of Love (if I may ſo repreſent it) burn in any heart? could he do more than die the bloody and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death of the Croſs for to ſave ſinners? How is it poſſible that the remembrance of this tender love and compaſſion ſhould ever die? or that any heart ſhould freeze over ſuch a fire? unleſs we be willfully care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I ſee that he will have our love: he will not ſuffer any thing to rob him of the purchaſe of his blood. For leſt we ſhould prove ſo ungrateful as to let him ſlip out of our mind, he hath left himſelf ſtill among us in ſenſible ſigns and repreſentations. By theſe he ſhews us his bloody death and paſſion: he makes himſelf preſent to our faith: and we may ſee that he is deſirous to do more than die for us; having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a way to live for ever in us, and be firmly united to us.</p>
                     <p>What manner of love is this that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath manifeſted unto us? who can refrain from tears of grief and ſorrow to think of his own ingratitude; and from tears of joy to think of the wonderful kindneſs of the Lord? can you look on him
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62913:91"/>
who was pierced for our ſins, and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn? can you ſee his bleeding wounds and not be troubled? no pious heart can be ſo hard. And yet when you conſider that by thoſe ſtripes you are healed; that he hath waſhed us from our ſins in this blood; that faithful ſouls may take ſanctuary in his wounds, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſafe: you cannot chuſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, and be glad in his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Call to your Soul then and bid it awaken in it ſelf the livelieſt thoughts of him, and the devouteſt affections to him. Call to it, to put it ſelf in tune, to ſtring (as I may ſo ſpeak) the inſtruments of joy and praiſe; and to ſtir up all the graces of the holy Spirit. That ſo you may go with a deep humility; a godly ſorrow; a perfect hatred of all ſin, both of the fleſh and of the ſpirit; a ſtrong reſolution againſt them: with a lowly faith; and in the heights of love; with enlarged deſires, and great longings to this holy Feaſt. Ask your Soul, what doſt thou think of? what doſt thou love? what doſt thou long for? with what intentions art thou going to the Lords Table? are the Treaſures of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wiſdom and knowledg, more in thine
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62913:92"/>
account than thouſands of gold and ſilver? Doſt thou heartily believe the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt Jeſus; and love him and his Religion in ſincerity? Is all ſin already bleeding to death in thee, and hadſt thou rather die than willingly offend thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that died for thee? Art thou going to hang all remaining affection to them upon his Croſs; that there they may be perfectly crucified, and never taken down till by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Meditation on it, they be quite dead? Reſolve then to go and tell him as much: to declare and ſhew to him that this is the ſenſe of thine heart. Only ask thy ſelf again; what appetite doſt thou feel in thee? Art thou going as a thirſty man to his drink; or a hungry man to his food; or a Bride to the marriage of a choſen ſoul, dearer than all the world beſide? or doſt thou feel ſomething like theſe things in thine heart? what is it that thou hungreſt and thirſteſt after? Is it the taſts of the love of God? Is it his Divine Grace and holy Spirit? Doſt thou long to be more like him, and made pertaker of his divine Nature? Art thou going to make a new reſignation of thy ſelf to him; to be made one Spirit with him, never any more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him? Then think how the Bride-groom will welcome thee: how our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62913:92"/>
I mean, will declare and ſet forth his love to thee; and give thee aſſurances that his mercy indureth for ever; and bid thee rejoyce and be exceeding glad in what he hath done already, and in the hopes thou haſt of what he will do hereafter.</p>
                     <p>And here you may call to mind how the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us: how he manifeſted forth his glory by his wonderful works: how he taught us the way to eternal life; and at laſt was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered into the hands of ſinful men, and was crucified and dyed for us: with all the reſt that concerns the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt. That ſo you may have it more ready in your thoughts, when you come to his Table; to do this in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of him.</p>
                     <p>In this manner alſo you may bewail the ſins of your former life; ſue for a pardon of what is paſt; and beſeech the grace of his holy Spirit, to aſſiſt your reſolutions of well doing for the time to come.</p>

                     <p>O Eternal and moſt bleſſed God, the fountain of being and bliſs; infinite in perfection; and highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all our words or thoughts. I am aſtoniſhed at the thoughts of the brightneſs of thy glory: and juſtly afraid to preſent my ſelf before ſo great and holy a Majeſty. Even that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace which invites me to thee, abaſhes me too; when I reflect upon my ſhameful ingratitude to ſuch unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved love. It becomes me to ly down in dejection of Spirit and mournful ſilence; rather than confidently to lift up mine eyes towards Heaven to ſpeak unto thee. But ſince thou art ſo rich in Mercy, as to require repenting ſinners to draw nigh to the Throne of Grace; I proſtrate my ſelf in the humbleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence before the ſearcher of all hearts. Not to excuſe, thou knoweſt, but to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62913:93"/>
aggravate my faults: to acknowledg the juſtice and equity of thy Laws; to condemn my ſelf for oppoſing thy Soveraign authority; and to vow to thee the moſt ſincere and hearty obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the reſt of my life.</p>
                     <p>I have done ſo much evil and ſo little good; been ſo eager in the purſuit of the things of this world, and ſo cold and unconcern'd many times about thoſe of eternity; ſo unmindful of my promiſes, unthankful for thy benefits, and unfruitful in the knowledg of the Lord Jeſus: that it is a wonder of thy patience, that I am ſtill alive, and not cut down like a barren tree that cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the ground. For ever adored be thy ſparing Mercy, which hath born ſo long with an unprofitable ſervant: who hath ſo many ways offended, in thought word and deed againſt thy divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty—<note n="*" place="margin">Here rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up thoſe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, you are conſcious of,</note> I have not given thee that honour, worſhip and ſervice, which I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62913:94"/>
owe to my Almighty Creator. Nor laid to heart, as I ought, thine infinite love in Chriſt my Redeemer. Nor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed the godly motions of thy holy Spirit; which thou haſt ſent to renew and ſanctifie my affections, and draw me to thine obedience. I have not lived according to the faith which I continually confeſs: But behaved my ſelf too oft as if I dreaded not the threatnings, and valued not the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of my Lord Chriſt: as if I feared not his vengeance, nor cared for his glorious rewards; and as if he would not come to judg the world, and render to all men according to their works.</p>
                     <p>The ſtupid inſenſibleneſs of mine heart, even now that I remember theſe things, brings new accuſations againſt me. It teſtifies that I know not, as I ought, the terror of the Lord: but am apt raſhly to mention thy Name, without an awful and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62913:94"/>
regard to thy infinite greatneſs, power and holineſs, before which I approach. I am no more worthy to be called thy ſervant; much leſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with any offering; or receive the leaſt of thy bleſſings. Nothing but ſhame and confuſion of face belong to me: and it is only of thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that I am not lamenting thoſe follies in weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth; which I ſpeak of now with ſo little grief and bitterneſs of Spirit. Mercy, Mercy; ſtill more Mercy, good Lord, I moſt humbly beſeech thee. O that a greater fear and dread of thee may now fall down mightily upon me, and overſpread me! O that I may feel ſuch a ſtrong ſenſe of thine incomprehenſible Majeſty preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my heart, that may bear down all other thoughts; and ſink me low, and make me abhor my ſelf in thy ſight! I know the Sacrifices of the Lord are a broken Spirit; a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62913:95"/>
heart, O God, thou wilt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe. And Jeſus hath alſo offered himſelf a ſacrifice for us, in whom thou haſt declared that thou art well pleaſed. For Jeſus his ſake diſpoſe me now to offer unto thee that acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And give me grace ever to fear thee, and to walk humbly with thee; to preſerve a tender ſenſe of my duty toward thee, and conſcientiouſly to obey thee: that ſo, by vertue of his Sacrifice of himſelf, all my ſins may be done away and remembred no more. Bleſſed be God, that I have any hope of that great mercy. Bleſſed be God, who by him hath given us everlaſting conſolation and good hope through his grace. By him I will offer up to thee continually the ſacrifice of praiſe, giving thanks to thy Name. Yea, the mercies of thee my God move me, to preſent my body a living ſacrifice, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acceptable unto thee, which is my reaſonable ſervice. I dedicate my ſelf
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62913:95"/>
abſolutely to thy obedience. I vow that I will never willingly depart from thy precepts. Aſſiſt and ſtrengthen me mercifully with thy grace that I may perform my vows: and never be ſo unreaſonable as to return to thoſe ſins, which are the burden of my heart, and grieve thy holy Spirit; which rent the fleſh and ſhed the blood of the Lord Jeſus; and which I have ſo often and ſo ſolemnly proteſted againſt.</p>
                     <p>And now that I am going to thine holy Table, to commemorate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of my Saviour; to give thee farther teſtimonies of my love to thee; and receive new tokens of thy love to me: O Lord, vouchſafe to make thy ſelf powerfully preſent to my mind. Repreſent thy ſelf and thy Son Jeſus ſo lively to my thoughts, in all thy wiſdom, power, goodneſs, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth; that I may never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee any more: but moſt ſeriouſly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62913:96"/>
reverence thee, and love thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thee, and truſt thee and obey thee, all the dayes of my life. Imprint the very image of thy Son upon me: that I may carry him ever in mine heart, and have his life and death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before mine eyes; and in all things conform my ſelf to his will, and faſhion my ſelf after his holy example. Come, Lord Jeſus, and poſſeſs thy ſelf of my whole man. Purifie me from all remaining filthineſs either of the fleſh or of the Spirit. Bring in all thy heavenly graces along with thee into my ſoul. And be my perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by giving me a fuller commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of thy holy Spirit, and more mighty aids to do my duty towards thee and towards all men.</p>
                     <p>And for that end, compoſe mine unſetled thoughts before I approach to receive the holy Myſteries. That I may attend thee with a full and clear
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62913:96"/>
conception of their meaning; with an actual belief of thy whole Goſpel; with moſt ſenſible love to thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be more like thee; with thy high praiſes in my mouth, and joy unſpeakable in mine heart. May I preſume, moſt gracious Father, to ask ſuch taſtes and relliſhes of thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous love, that I may never be able to delight in any thing ſo much as in the remembrance of it. But mine eyes may be ever towards the Lord; and I may hunger and thirſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually after thy righteouſneſs: till I am perfectly made pertaker of thy divine nature, and rendred meet to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that high and holy place; where I ſhall ſee thee not as now in myſterious repreſentations, but openly and face to face. Amen, Lord Jeſus: who art able to ſave to the uttermoſt all them that come to God by thee. In thy moſt bleſſed name and words I continue my humble prayers. <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Have I been a perfect ſtranger to him, who loves me ſo much, who ſpake ſo kindly then unto me, and gave me ſuch aſſurances of his everlaſting kindneſs? O ſhameleſs ingratitude!

That armed with thy power, all thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may flee before thee, and no evil thing may dwell in thy ſight: but I may overcome the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, and ſerve thee without fear in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the dayes of my life. <hi>Hear my words, O Lord, conſider my meditation.</hi>

And therefore ask your ſelf in the moſt ſerious manner, and bid your ſoul tell you, with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath the death of the Lord been now remembred? Haſt thou as ſincerely renounced all thy evil wayes and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy ſelf to the life of Chriſt, as thou hopeſt to be ſaved?

It concerns me nearly, O my ſoul, to keep him ever in my thoughts, and to expreſs him in my life.

It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, O Lord, that thou wouldeſt be at ſuch expenſe about thoſe, who had choſen to be any thing rather than ſuch
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62913:116"/>
as thou madeſt them. None but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite compaſſion could be ſo tender of thoſe who deſpiſed thy Image, and loved to live like the beaſts that periſh. None but thou, O merciful God, could think of beſtowing greater benefits on ſuch brutiſh ſinners. And nothing but a ſtupid negligence and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inconſiderateneſs, could ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be made pertakers of ſuch end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happineſs as thou deſigneſt to us. I am one of thoſe ſtrange things that have forſaken thee, and know not why. Who was long inſenſible of thy grace, and unmoveable under thy greateſt importunities to return to thee. And ſince thou haſt prevailed with me, am too much inclined to content my ſelf with a ſmall degree of likeneſs to thee: and apt to find out little pretences and excuſes, for the doing of my own will, rather than thine. And that though I am ſo ſolemnly conſecrated to thee, and have been inſtructed in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62913:116"/>
thy bleſſed Goſpel, and put in hopes of ſuch glorious rewards, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch incouragements at thy Table; where I have frequently promiſed chearful obedience in all things.</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed be thy inconceivable love, O moſt gracious Lord, who haſt ſhed thy blood for thoſe who ſin againſt that love; if with all their hearts and all their ſouls they return unto thee. For ever magnified be thy mercy, who haſt given us ſo many aſſurances of the truth of thy love to us; and ſo many opportunities to teſtifie the truth of ours towards thee. Thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not only by thy word, thy promiſe and oath to give us ground of hope: but even by outward and ſenſible ſigns to incourage our weak and juſtly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faith. For who can but tremble to think, that he hath at any time offended the majeſty of Heaven and earth? and yet who can but hope, that hears the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62913:117"/>
voice of thy Son inviting us to come unto thee, and promiſing a pardon to returning ſinners? O thou who calleſt me now again to thy holy Table, and there haſt made ſuch rich proviſion for us: aſſiſt I moſt humbly beſeech thee all the Meditations, deſires and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of my ſoul in that holy action. That I may remember all that the Lord Jeſus hath done and ſuffered for me, with ſuch an humble admiration, a lively faith, and a thankful love; that I may feel my heart tied faſter to him with the cords of his love; and ſent up to Heaven, as the whole burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to the Lord. Draw me, O God of love, more powerfully to thee and fill me more with wiſdom and goodneſs; that my mind may more clearly diſcern between things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; my will may become more eaſy to all that is good, and more obſtinate againſt all that is evil; and that every affection and paſſion may be more
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62913:117"/>
gentle and ſubmiſſive to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy holy Laws. Poſſeſs my heart againſt all the force of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a never dying ſenſe of thy goodneſs, and a remembrance of thoſe joys which thou haſt prepared for thoſe that love thee. O that all my graces may receive increaſe of nouriſhment: that I may more perfectly imitate the humility, the meekneſs, the patience, the charity, the reſignation and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience of my Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Jeſus Chriſt. He hath bidden us believe, that thou wilt give thy holy Spirit to thoſe that ask it; as readily as an earthly parent gives bread to his children. O let the power of that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon me; to fix my wandring thoughts, to raiſe up my heavy and dull affections, and to form all my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpoſes into a ſetled diſpoſition and temper of heart, to comply with thy bleſſed will in every thing. I am not worthy, I confeſs, of the ſmalleſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62913:118"/>
crumb of thy mercy: but thou haſt made me to hope for theſe great bleſſings, through thy grace declared unto us in Chriſt Jeſus. In whoſe words I further recommend my ſelf unto thy merciful kindneſs; ſaying,

I have beheld him preſenting himſelf unto me; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to make me pertaker of all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. With what affections did I meet and receive his ſtrange love? Did not my heart burn within me when he opened the Counſels of his heart to me? Did it not melt and diſſolve into love, when he ſhewed me how paſſionately he loved me? Did I not offer my ſelf both ſoul and body to him, and promiſe to be his faithful ſervant? Did I not remember that I was his already, and renew my vows to cleave unto him in loyal obedience? O what a transforming ſight was it, to behold <hi>Jeſus who was made a little lower than Angels for

                     <p>THE next time thou viſiteſt thy ſoul, ask it if it obſerved well that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon who feaſted thee at his Table: and marked the kind and gracious words which he ſpake unto thee, by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his broken body, and blood that was ſhed for thy ſake. Alas! wilt thou ſay, I ſhould not have been here, if I had had a clear view of his glories. He would have carried me to heaven with him, if my heart had been poſſeſſed with the fulneſs of his love. My eyes are too weak to behold his perfections: my thoughts too narrow to comprehend the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of his grace.</p>
                     <p>But haſt thou not ſeen ſomething of him? Did not many of his beauteous gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhine fairly in thine eyes? Did he not even force upon thee ſome ſenſe of his wondrous goodneſs and charity? And hath he not put himſelf, by ſenſible tokens, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy very hands; nay, entred into thine heart, and told thee; that he hath deſired it for his habitation. Where is he then? what haſt thou done with him? are the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62913:129"/>
thoughts of him vaniſhed already out of thy mind? Doth the love of him languiſh and die thus ſoon in thy breaſt? Art thou content to let him go, and ſee him no more; till the ſame ſolemnity come about again?</p>
                     <p>How wilt thou be able then to appear before him, at that time? with what face wilt thou look upon him, whom thou ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſo much; as to love any company bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his? Will it not confound thee to think that thou art but a ſtranger to him, though thou haſt been ſo often with him? and that he can find nothing of himſelf in thee; no, not after ſo many profeſſions of the greateſt love and friendſhip to him? O let him ſee, that he hath not beſtowed himſelf on one that knows not how to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſo divine a gueſt. Preſerve an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting memory of his dying love. Never fail to thank him for it every day, with the greateſt paſſion thou art able to excite. Look on him ſeriouſly and ſtudy to be like him. Never take off thine eyes from his beauties, till all his lovely qualities be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on thy heart. Imitate his humility and great condeſcention to us of low eſtate. Learn of him to be meek and lowly in heart.<note place="margin">

But the mouths of rational creatures ought moſt to be filled with thy praiſes: whom thou haſt made to underſtand the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and majeſty of all thy works.

Chriſt Jeſus. I bleſs thee, O God, for that abundant grace; and for that part and portion, which thou haſt given me in it. That thou waſt pleaſed to come ſo lovingly, and dwell among us; and appear in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; to what can I aſcribe it, but thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible love, and readineſs to do us good.

And that thou haſt proclaimed as much by thine eternal Word, and bidden us to hope in thy mercy. Above all, that thou haſt aſſured us by his Death and Paſſion, that thou wilt pardon our ſins; and by his Reſurrection, that thou wilt beſtow on us eternal life. There is no end, O Lord, of thy lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs. For thou continueſt to give us new aſſurances and tokens of thy good will towards us: and haſt

                     <p>O Moſt bleſſed God, who art moſt lovely in thy ſelf and in all thy works: and full of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us whom thou haſt made to underſtand thy glorious perfections. Thou art beloved of all thoſe that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly fix their eyes on the beauties of thy holineſs, wiſdom and goodneſs; and obſerve thy bounty to all thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Thouſands of Angels and Saints thou haſt, whoſe hearts burn continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with love to thee: and thou haſt had many faithful ſervants that have dyed for the love of thee. I am one of thoſe fools and ſenſeleſs wretches, that have loved every thing better than thee, my Creator, and merciful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. While others have burnt in the fires for thee, I have been unwilling ſometimes to take the pains of a few ſerious thoughts about thee. And my
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62913:136"/>
mind at beſt, is apt to ſtart away from that moſt heavenly employment: it is hard to think, even of thy ſurpaſſing kindneſs to me, without interruption, but for a few moments. I am too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the ancient Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus: being prone to content my ſelf with reading or hearing thy word, with ſpeaking of thee, or praying to thee: and all many times without any love, or but with little affection to thee. Yea, while I make mention of thy love, I am not ſo much in love with thee, as it deſerves. I have beheld the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhining upon me, and received the deareſt pledges of thy loving kindneſs; without that warmth and heat of love which it might have excited. The livelieſt Truths have not penetrated ſo deep, as they ſhould, into my heart. But though thou haſt been pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſo earneſtly, and promiſe ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, as if thou ſhouldſt be indebted
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62913:136"/>
to me for my love; it hath many times but little ſtirred this dull ſoul towards thee. Thou haſt loved us ſo much as to purchaſe our love at any rate: having redeemed us with thy Sons blood, which is the greateſt price; and called us to thy kingdom and glory, which is the greateſt reward: but alas! how unconcern'd have I been, too oft, in all theſe wonders of thy love?</p>
                     <p>I am aſhamed of my ſelf. I bluſh to think that after ſo long acquaintance with thee, I ſhould love thee and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thee to no higher a degree. Which is the only thing, next to thy grace which pitties our weakneſſes, that gives me hope I ſhall at laſt love thee far better. Still make me more aſhamed, that after all thy care and pains thou ſhouldſt ſee ſo little of thy ſelf in me. And aſſiſt me by the power of a mighty grace, which I will endeavour to improve, to fix mine eyes more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62913:137"/>
on thee, and to ſtay my thoughts with thee; till I love thee ſo much as to be changed into thy likeneſs. Now that I am going to commemorate thy love in Chriſt Jeſus, let not my ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude provoke thee to abſent thy ſelf from me: but according to the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant thou haſt made with us in his blood, be merciful to my ſins, and remember not mine iniquities againſt me. Make me know and feel that thou doſt pardon me, by exciting holy reſolutions in me to purifie my heart more perfectly; and diſpoſing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to love thy holy nature and will, and conform my ſelf unto it in all things. <hi>O that all carnal affections may die in me, and all things belonging to the ſpirit may live and grow in me. That I may have power and ſtrength to have victory and to triumph againſt the Devil, the world and the fleſh.</hi> That I may utterly hate every thing that is evil; and cleave moſt affectionately to that which is good.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62913:137"/>
Yea, that I may hate even Father and mother, and the deareſt thing in this world, rather than ſin againſt thee and forſake thee. That no relation, no pleaſure, no profitable injoyment, may ever turn my heart from thee, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw me to thee, and make me more in love with thee. All thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may juſtly complain of me, if I ſhould not love thee above them all. But how ſhall I anſwer it to our Lord Jeſus, if his love ſhould not conſtrain me?

                     <p>O <hi>Love, what haſt thou done?</hi> ſaid an holy man, when he thought of the Mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Thou broughteſt the Son of God down from Heaven, and made him appear in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man. Thou broughteſt him to his Croſs, and made him an offering of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God. <hi>O Love, what wouldeſt thou not do</hi> (mayeſt thou ſay to thy ſelf) if thou didſt but poſſeſs our hearts? That which made him like to us, and brought him down hither, would make us like to God and carry us up to Heaven. If I did but love God, what could he demand of me which I ſhould not immediately do? How naturally ſhould I ſtudy to pleaſe him? How eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful would it be to comply with his will? And what a favour ſhould I count it, that I might know his will which I am o do? None of his Commandments would be grievous to me; but all his ways pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all his paths peace. And will it not be very ſtrange, if I ſhould not love him, who hath loved me ſo much, and is ſtill demonſtrating his kindneſs to me? I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62913:139"/>
muſt forget my belief if I ſhould not love him: and <hi>that</hi> he will not let me forget; but calls me often to his holy Table, and feeds me with the ſweet remembrance of him. There he repreſents to me, that which I continually profeſs to believe. That he is the Father Almighty, of whom the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named. That Jeſus is his only Son our Lord; that he was conceived by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified and put to death, roſe again, aſcended to Gods right hand, and will come at laſt to judge the quick and dead. This is my Faith. May I never make confeſſion of it,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.2.20.</note> without feeling it excited <hi>to work by love.</hi> May it alway call to mind the vows I have made <hi>to live by this Faith of the Son of God.</hi>

                           <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</note> May it <hi>purifie my heart;</hi> that when he ſhall appear again and come to judge the world,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.</note> my <hi>faith may be found to praiſe, and honour, and glory.</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p>This was the reaſon, you may here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that good men anciently adviſed all Chriſtians to repeat the Creed every morning. Not as a Prayer, or a Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative from ſin, meerly by the force of the words: but to put them in mind that they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62913:139"/>
were the followers of Jeſus, who had done and ſuffered ſo much for them; and to quicken themſelves to love and to good works, which are the natural fruits of ſaith in Chriſt. Reſolve therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on it, for this end. Shew that thou doſt willingly remember the Lord Jeſus, and ſtudieſt to ſtir up his love in thy heart: and haſt not only ſome ſudden flaſhes of it forced upon thee, by the meer greatneſs and power of his love.

O what a kindneſs was this, mayeſt thou think with thy ſelf! what wonder of love, which is here fairly repreſented to us and ſet before our eyes! what a pleaſure is it to ſee our ſelves thus beloved of the Sovereign of the world! to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62913:140"/>
behold our ſelves in the arms of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the only wiſe, and all-ſufficient good! who will never fail to take care of us, provide for us, direct, ſupport, aſſiſt, comfort and protect us; yea, and eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſs us. This is love indeed, that we have ſuch pledges given us of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs; that we ſhall ſee him in the other world, where we ſhall know him and love him as much as we can deſire. Nay, what an happineſs is it, that we can love him at all? And that he will take ſuch care to excite our love to ſo great an height in this world? O what pleaſures have I felt in loving him; and offering my heart with ſincere affection to him? How doth my will ſweetly melt into his; when I think how good he is, and how much I am obliged to him? We ſhould never have praiſed him ſo much, if he had not thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his love to us: And that, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with intire friendſhip and concord (to which he alſo here ingages us) is the happineſs of Angels and glorified Spirits. I will never ceaſe to think of theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that I may never ceaſe to injoy them: but be ſtill more and more praiſing thee, till I come to praiſe thee in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Bleſſed.</p>

                     <p>O Moſt holy and ever bleſſed God; Thy name alone is excellent; thy glory is above the Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. All the heavenly powers conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually proclaim thy greatneſs; and raiſe themſelves, not thee, by admiring, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and praiſing thy eternal Majeſty. I moſt humbly adore and extol thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Wiſdom, thy uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power, thy boundleſs Goodneſs, and thy unſpotted Holineſs and Truth. It is a ſhame, I acknowledge, that ever I ſhould think of eſteeming or loving any thing like to thee, who art ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above all the world; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo impoſſible for me to be ſafe or happy, but in thy love. And it is no leſs ſhame to make mention of thy Name, without the greateſt joy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of heart in thy love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For thy wiſdom is the ſureſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62913:141"/>
guide and moſt certain director: thy Power is our ſtrength and ſafeguard: thy good Providence is our all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent treaſure: thy holineſs and truth is our ſecurity: thy goodneſs is our hope and comfort: thy unerring will is our ſatisfaction, in all events that here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us. I cannot wiſh, when I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly recollect my ſelf, to live in a world without thee. It would be better not to be at all, than to be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thee, and left to the conduct of my own childiſh thoughts and deſires; and to the protection and proviſion of my own weakneſs. How much do I owe thee, even for this knowledge of thee? And I have had daily, yea mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely experience of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ever ſince I had a being. A great number of thy creatures ſerve me, and miniſter unto my content and comfort, by thy command. And thy own Son is become a Servant to me, and ſubmitted himſelf to the vileſt ſtate
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62913:141"/>
and condition for my happineſs. I deſerve not to live, if I ſhould not love thee intirely. For thou art every day adding new fuel to my love, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care that it may never go out. What tokens of thy love hath this day brought along with it to my Soul? Thou haſt given me leave to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and feaſt with thee at thy own Table: To ſee the love that the Lord Jeſus bare and ſtill continues to me; that I may be ſtill more induced to love thee, and ſtrongly ingaged to be ſo happy, as to continue in thy love by cordial obedience to thee. Who can look on thee, O bleſſed Lord, and not love thee? Who can think of what thou haſt done unto us, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf eternally to thy love and ſervice? But alas! our eyes are weak; our thoughts are ſhort and tranſient; we are ſoon weary of beholding, and thinking even on thy love. Direct my thoughts therefore by thy mighty
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62913:142"/>
power, more ſtrongly towards thee. Faſten in my mind a more lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee: that I may, at leaſt, be often looking back unto thee, and delight to reflect upon thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous love.<note place="margin">

Didſt thou not proteſt, that nothing was ſo dear unto thee as thy Saviour, and his Commands and pretious promiſes? That thou hadſt rather loſe thy life, than loſe his favour? And didſt thou not reſolve that thou wouldſt preſerve it as thy life, by all the acts of love to God and man? O how eaſily do we forget the greateſt benefits? How apt are we to pay him only with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral promiſes?

He hath bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thee, by thoſe tokens, reſt aſſured that he will never ceaſe to love thee. For he hath given himſelf to thee; and thou haſt given thy ſelf to him. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of friendſhip and eternal love hath
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62913:148"/>
been renewed between us. Thou haſt made oath again of fidelity to him, and he hath ſworn in his holineſs, that he will not take his loving kindneſs from thee, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail. O how rich is he, that poſſeſſes God; and is heir of his immortal glory! How chary ſhould we be of this ineſtimable wealth? How void ſhould we be of all other cares, but only this; to preſerve the love of our heavenly Father? What ſhould covetouſneſs do in that heart, which enjoys ſuch a Treaſure? What ſhould ambition, what ſhould vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory do in him; that can boaſt of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of having God for his Father? Need he fear that he ſhall want, who is ſo well provided? Should he murmur or repine, who hath ſuch fulneſs? Is there any cauſe of anger, if our Father be not angry? Shall we be uncharitable to any, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſuch great charity? Watch, O my Soul, and walk circumſpectly, that thou loſe not ſuch exceeding abundant grace, as this which is beſtowed on thee. Go forth in this new ſtrength and comfort which thou haſt received, and perfect thy conqueſts over the world, the fleſh, and the Devil: and reſolve that nothing ſhall ſeparate thee from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>

For what is it that hath tempted thee, and drawn thy heart at any time from him? Nothing but a little ſhort pleaſure. Nothing but a vain, and many times fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, breath of a mortal man; whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and muſt ſhortly die, and all his thoughts periſh. Nothing but that which the Moth can corrupt, or the ruſt conſume, or a Thief deſpoil us of. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a fading beauty, which ſickneſs or time will certainly bring to decay. What are all theſe to the pleaſure of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God? to the commendation and praiſe which comes from unerring and eternal wiſdom? to the durable riches, honour and beauty which our heavenly Father will give us for our portion? Our hopes in him now are infinitely better, than any thing elſe. The love of ſuch a Father is more worth, than all that the whole World can do for us.

                     <p>HOW can I think that I love my Saviour ſo dearly, as I ought? And without love who can be welcome gueſts at his holy Table? They are often in my thoughts, whom I love with a ſenſible paſſion. My mind is perpetually looking towards them. I delight in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſation; and ever labour to recommend my ſelf to their affections, by conforming my ſelf to their will and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. How do I ſtudy to pleaſe them? And if they will tell me what will pleaſe them, O how glad am I of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſerve them? Nay I can croſs my ſelf and my own inclinations, to follow theirs. I love they ſhould be honoured and eſteemed by all. I am much caſt down, if I have given them any diſguſt: and not a little troubled, that others have offended them, or done them any wrong. O that I felt but this little ſign of a tender love and regard to my ſweet Redeemer! that my heart were wounded (now that I am going to behold his wounds) for the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62913:154"/>
juſt offence I have at any time given him; and the great forgetfulneſs and ingratitude of moſt of thoſe that are called by his Name. He may well be diſpleaſed, if it be but for the defects of my love, and the coldneſs of my affection to him; who hath deſerved to be remembred with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſion. For I have long profeſſed love to him. I have received many teſtimonies of his ſpecial kindneſs to me; and given many aſſurances of mine to him. And yet how pale and dim are thoſe marks of a great love to him, which are plainly viſible in me to others? Am I ever caſting mine eyes towards him? Doth he often preſent himſelf before my mind, and feelingly touch my heart? Am I never better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than when I am going to him? Is the queſtion rather what will pleaſe him, than whether I ſhall do it? He hath declared his will in his holy Goſpel; Am I glad to hear of it, and read it, and very deſirous to know it in all things? Can I forſake my own will chearfully, to follow his? And doth it grieve me much that his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent laws are not obſerved; and that all Chriſtians do not love and honour him?</p>
                     <p>O Lord, thou knoweſt our weakneſs; and how hard it is to keep our minds and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62913:154"/>
hearts ſo ſtedfaſtly fixed upon inviſible things. And in great pitty therefore haſt ordained holy myſteries, for a frequent remembrance of thee; and to repreſent thy ſelf and thy love more ſenſibly to us. By this means I hope to grow in time to a perfect love: ever bearing thee in mind; and delighting to give thee thanks and praiſe; and conforming my ſelf to thy bleſſed will; and deſiring and ſtudying that thy name may be hallowed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by me and by all men elſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. This hope incourages me to go to thy Table, though very unworthy to be entertained by thee. There I hope alſo, my Lord will meet me, and ſpeak kindly to me; as one that loves him, at leaſt, a little better than any thing beſide; and is reſolved and determined to love him more and more. He invites us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to increaſe our faith, and to nouriſh our love, and to ſtrengthen our hope, and excite our gratitude; and exerciſe all our graces: and therefore I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his kindneſs; even becauſe I deſire and long to love him ſo much.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, my ſoul, let us examine our ſelves, whether we be ſure that this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is the very ſenſe of our heart: that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62913:155"/>
we really love to pleaſe him in every thing; and heartily mean to proceed in this love, to the moſt ready and willing obedience to all his Commands. And doth it not become us humbly to confeſs the fooliſh wandrings of our affections from him; to bluſh for ſhame that we fall ſo ſhort of our own reſolutions; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our ſelves to greater watchfulneſs and diligence in well doing? Ought not the very remembrance of our former cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to put a greater heat into us? And our former backwardneſs, make us to be more forward and zealous? Should we not vow our hearts again to him? And let him know, that we ſhall not think we live when we do not love him; and that we ſhall be willing to die that we may more love him? But how can we hope to grow ſtill better, by theſe new expreſſions of his love to which he invites us; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his gracious aſſiſtance, which ought to be faithfully implored? Let us go then to him before-hand, and deſire him to raiſe up thoſe thoughts and affections in us, which we cannot produce in our ſelves: that we may bring an heart full of love to him and carry it away full of joy, to find it more inlarged to love and ſerve him.</p>

                     <p>O Moſt holy and ever bleſſed Lord of heaven and earth; <hi>who art good and doſt good</hi> to all thy Creatures, and to us above all the reſt, who are moſt unworthy of thy loving kindneſs. It is but a part of my duty to admire and praiſe thy great and glorious perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to reverence thee, to worſhip thee, to love thee, and with heart and tongue both here and eternally to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my dependance on thee, to give thee thanks and ſpeak good of thy Name. But it becomes me no leſs to debaſe my ſelf in the loweſt manner before thee; becauſe all that I ſpeak in thy praiſe, declares my foul ingratitude to thee my Creator and conſtant bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. There is nothing that I can juſtly call my own, without thy leave, and I have received exceeding much from thy bounty, and thou haſt made
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62913:156"/>
me that I might enjoy ſatisfaction in thee, the moſt Soveraign good, and taken care to bring me acquainted with thee; which ought now to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the greateſt humility, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and joyful reſignation of my ſelf and all that I have to thy obedience. But alas! how little do I feel thee, though I live and move and have my being in thee? Though I have taſted of thine abundant goodneſs every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how late was it before I ſeriouſly thought of my obligations to thee? Now that I ſee thou haſt ſent thy ſon, the expreſs image of thy perſon among us, how little is it that I know of thee, and what a ſtranger am I ſtill to thee? I have been too willing to receive but ſmall benefit by his appearing; and to content my ſelf with a little meaſure of that purity, wiſdom and goodneſs, which he came to impart unto us. Thus fooliſh and ignorant have I been: and it was but fit that we ſhould ſink into
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62913:156"/>
the greateſt ſtupidity, when we were ſuch fools as to leave thee, and follow the counſels and deſires of our own hearts. For ever adored be thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite charity, who art not willing to loſe us, when we are ſo forward to loſe thee and our ſelves. Bleſſed be the exceeding abundance of thy grace in Chriſt Jeſus, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to invite even ſuch ſenſeleſs wretches to come unto thee; who have ſo little eſteemed it, or know how to value the unſearchable riches of it. The marvellous greatneſs of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and pardoning mercy, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, will incline and excite my heart, I hope, to love thee much above all things. That ſo at laſt I may love thy bleſſed nature, and perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it is my happineſs, to have thy image renewed in me, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. Thou haſt often convinced me, praiſed be thy goodneſs, that it is impoſſible for me
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62913:157"/>
otherwiſe to be happy. Thou haſt wrought many ſtrong reſolutions in my ſoul, to be guided and governed by thine unerring wiſdom, and holy will. And I have felt the comforts of a pure, humble, meek, merciful, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and loving diſpoſition of heart. Perfect, good Lord, what thou haſt wrought in me: that all the pious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of my ſoul, may ſettle in a firm and laſting habit of well-doing. Our righteouſneſs, I know, cannot profit thee; but thou delighteſt to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thy ſelf to thy creatures; eſpecially to thoſe who think it the greateſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be inriched with thy wiſdom, and to be made partakers of a divine Nature. O thou who haſt given me this knowledg, who haſt given me a will to chuſe thee for my portion, make me compleatly happy in being made exactly like unto thee.</p>
                     <p>Meet me graciouſly when I approach to thy Table, and repreſent thy Son
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62913:157"/>
Jeſus ſo feelingly to me; that my mind may be more clearly illuminated to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the beauteous perfections of his holineſs, and my will more ſtrongly bent to cleave unto him, and all the powers of my ſoul mightily inlivened to follow and imitate him to the end. I go with a deſire, O Lord, to learn of him; that I may henceforth have low thoughts of my ſelf, as having received all I have from thy fulneſs; and low thoughts of all enjoyments on earth, as a ſmall part of that happineſs to which thou haſt deſigned me; and hateful thoughts of every ſin, as that which is oppoſite both to thee and to my own happineſs. O that the thoughts of thy goodneſs, may ever hereafter make me partaker of more of thy holineſs: that thy mercy and indulgence may never tempt me in the leaſt to offend thee, but rather affright me into thy obedience: that I may love thee ſo much as to feel it a ſatisfaction to croſs my own deſires,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62913:158"/>
to fulfil thy will and pleaſure. O that it may be a comfort to me, to be able to deny them; and that I may account it the greateſt victory to overcome my ſelf; my higheſt triumph that thou, Lord, conquereſt, and makeſt me thy willing ſubject. I hope to be ſubdued perfectly unto thee, and enabled to maintain a ſoveraign dominion over all things here: ſo that I may uſe them all ſoberly, moderately and with due acknowledgments to thee, and charity to men, but be brought in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none. <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord Jeſus; who liveſt and reigneſt for ever, with the Father and the holy Spirit, in power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:<note place="margin">

                     <p>WHat makes thee ſigh, my Soul, now that thou haſt been with thy Saviour?

Alas! we cannot endure always to dwell in his houſe: we are too weak, while we are in this fleſhly Tabernacle, to remain in the heights of love.

His love is ſo great, that one would think it ſhould never ſlip out of thy mind. Our Lord hath done ſuch great things for us, that we may be tempted ſooner not to believe them, than to forget them. But this is one piece of the greatneſs of that love, that it hath taken care it ſhould be alway remembered.

Doth it make thee ſigh to think of going to receive the tokens of his love? To repreſent the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt Jeſus for thy ſins? To wait on God for the pardon of them? And to be put in aſſured hope of immortal life? Thou art not ſuch a ſtranger, ſure, to thy own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but knoweſt better things; even things that accompany ſalvation. Give glory therefore to the Lord that he calls thee again ſo graciouſly to ſhew forth his death: Let him know that thou meaneſt to obey him; (to attend him at his holy Table,) and thank him too. But with what bluſhing ſhould we look there upon that love, which we have ſometime ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? With what hatred, upon thoſe ſins which murdered the Lord of life? With what joy ſhould we think of the hope there is, that they may be pardoned? And how ſhould we ſtand admiring at that wiſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which made that blood, which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhed, to be the expiation for their ſins? Sure we do not believe theſe things: or elſe we ſhall begin already to feel our heart burn with love to him; and ready to offer it ſelf in Sacrifice, before we come to his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62913:164"/>
Altar. Excite thy Faith; that it may ſtir up thy Love: and that may carry all the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy heart along with it to him. Shew him that the deſire of thy heart is to the remembrance of his Name; that thy care is to pleaſe him; thy fear to offend him; thy joy to do his will; and thy ſorrow that thou canſt do no more for him. Let it be a great comfort to thee, that he knows thy ſincerity, and ſees into the very ſecrets of thy heart: how affectionately thou ſtudieſt to be like him; what a pleaſure it is when thou canſt ſtedfaſtly think of him; how it grieves thee when thy thoughts are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, thy affections heavy and dull, and thy power falls ſo ſhort of thy will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. And be aſſured that he pitties thee; that notwithſtanding this he will kindly entertain thee; and receive the pooreſt oblation thou art able to make him at his Table. <hi>Eat and be ſatisfied, and bleſs the name of the Lord.</hi> He hath invited thee; he expects thee; he loves to ſee thee there; and will make thee know that he loves thee, and delights to do thee good.</p>
                     <p>Let us go, my ſoul, and declare before Angels and men that we are Chriſtians; and mean to live and die in his holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And let us now take ſhame to our

ſelves that we have at any time contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted our belief. Let us acknowledg the breach of that Faith into which we were baptized: and declare before we go how great a trouble it is to us, that we love him no more; and how deſirous we are and fully reſolved to love him better and better.</p>

                     <p>O Eternal God, the Lord of life, of grace, peace and all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. It is of thy great mercies alone that I am not conſumed; or that I lie not now groaning on a bed of ſickneſs: but am invited to feaſt at thy holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I might have diſtaſted and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even the ordinary food of my body; and thou continueſt an opportunity, and ſome appetite to receive the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous food of my ſoul. The grave might have been my dwelling, the worms my companions, and I been turned into rottenneſs and corruption: but now I am going to thy houſe, to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62913:165"/>
of thy people, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with thee and my bleſſed Saviour; that I may be nouriſhed to a bleſſed immortality. This is nothing elſe but thy marvellous Mercy, and becauſe thy compaſſions fail not: For I have too many ways violated thy holy Laws, broken thy covenant, reſiſted thy grace, and unvalued thy eternal life. Thou haſt adopted me early for thy child, ſown the immortal ſeed of thy word in my heart, ſent thy holy Spirit to further its growth and increaſe to that never dying happineſs and bliſs. But how little have I recovered of thy image in wiſdom, righteouſneſs and holineſs, which hath been miſerably defaced? How coldly have I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entertained the motions of thy holy Spirit? And been barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful in the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt? How often have I heard of that great and dreadful day of reckoning; and been prone to follow the little pleaſures
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62913:166"/>
of this life, as if I lookt neither for joy nor miſery in the other world? That Faith which ſhould ſave me, might juſtly condemn me: and Jeſus my moſt compaſſionate Redeemer, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, become only a ſevere Judge towards me.</p>
                     <p>Adored be thy patience and long-ſuffering to ſinners. For ever magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied be that Grace, which gives me the leaſt hope in thee: and preſents me with another opportunity of humbling my ſelf before thee; of intreating thy favour; of deprecating thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and vowing my ſelf again to thy ſervice which I have covenanted to pay thee. O merciful God, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me; have mercy upon me: according to the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in Chriſt Jeſus, blot out all my iniquities. I have not offended thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the heighth, and depth, and length and breadth of thine incomprehenſible
<pb facs="tcp:62913:166"/>
love in him declared to us. And there is ſtill remaining in my heart ſome eſteem of that love, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to love thee above all things; with an hearty deſire to be purified and ſanctified throughout both in body and in ſoul and ſpirit. Though not by works of righteouſneſs which I have done, yet by thy mercy I hope to be ſaved, through the waſhing of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and more perfect renewing of the holy-Ghoſt. That renewing vertue from above I moſt humbly wait for, and earneſtly deſire to be more abundantly poured on me. Deal with me according to my unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to ſtudy to purifie my ſelf, even as thou art pure: to walk before thee hereafter in all ſobriety, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility, meekneſs, peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, charity; indeavouring to perfect holineſs in thy fear. Vouchſafe me ſome earneſts of this grace, when I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelf before thee, to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

the death of thy Son Jeſus; who was wounded for our iniquities, and bruiſed for our tranſgreſſions. That my heart may be deeply wounded with a ſenſe of ſin; and hate the very thought of every evil way; and chuſe to endure any miſery, rather than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy deareſt love again. O that I might then feel my thoughts carried away from this world: that I could think then of nothing but thee; and the dying love of my ſweeteſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and the greatneſs of that love which I owe to him, that died for me. Repleniſh my ſoul with holy thoughts; lift me up in heavenly meditations; and fill me with a multitude of devout affections: that I may be able here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to do and ſuffer all things for his ſake; and never forget how good he is, and how good I have reſolved to be.

                     <p>SEeing it hath pleaſed my Lord to tye me to himſelf, by one bond more; and I have added a new reſolution to all the reſt, and made choice of him again for my only Maſter; how careful ought I to be that I prove not a falſe Diſciple? Haſt thou never read or heard of an holy man, who never uſed the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately added, not without the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſingular pleaſure, MY MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER? This was his glory; this he thought the higheſt honour on Earth, that he ſerved ſuch a Maſter. Let this be one of thy thoughts every day: Let it work in thy mind, till the ſenſe of theſe words be ingraven on thy heart, <hi>My Maſter JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> Conſider that when thou waſt baptized, thou waſt dedicated to his holy ſervice. That if thou haſt owned &amp; confirmed that Sacred Covenant, thou haſt renounced all other Maſters, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; and profeſſed thou wouldſt be a Servant of Jeſus. And every time thou haſt been at his Table, thou haſt done this over again; and proteſted thou wilt have no other Maſter, but only him. Is there
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62913:168"/>
any cauſe doſt thou think, to repent of thy choice of following his ſervice? Is it not a great preferment to be one of his family, who <hi>is Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Heir of all things, the Prince of all the Kings of the Earth, the Lord of Life, and the King of Glory?</hi> Doſt thou not profeſs in thy daily Prayers, that <hi>his ſervice is perfect freedom?</hi> Can any reward their ſervants, like to the <hi>bleſſed and only Potentate, who only hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?</hi> Do any ſervants in the world ſerve in ſuch hopes, or enjoy ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or receive ſuch earneſts, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beſtow on his? Is not death the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin; but the gift of God eternal life? What ſervants are admitted to ſuch familiarity with their Lord, as thou art at his Table? Who are entertained with ſuch a Feaſt, or live upon ſuch delights, as they that receive his Body and Bloud? And yet how zealous, how diligent, how forward are they to do their Maſters will, who ſerve only for the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? How proud is a man of the honour to follow the Court of an Earthly Prince? But if he ſhould be advanced to eat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at his Table, the world would envy his too great happineſs. What a ſhame will it prove then, if thou art not <hi>fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord?</hi> If thou doſt not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62913:169"/>
think thy ſelf honoured enough, and art not well contented in any condition, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt ſuch a glorious Maſter? Thou wilt not pardon thy ſelf, if thou art unfaithful to him; or diſgraceſt his ſervice by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, repining, dejection of ſpirit; or any other unworthy behaviour toward him. For what Maſter ever merited ſo much at his Servants hands? We have heard of Servants, that have died for their Maſters; but where did we ever read or hear of a Maſter that freely died, even for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Servants? The buſineſs was, Jeſus would purchaſe us to himſelf by his own Bloud: and make us, if we have but any good nature in us, to be moſt entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his chearful obedience. Ask thy ſelf therefore every morning, whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant am I? What did I promiſe my Maſter ſuch a day? If I call him Lord and Maſter, why do not I do the things that he ſaith? And ſhall I go about my Maſters buſineſs with a drooping countenance, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy heart? Shall I ſigh when I hear his voice, though he bid me deny my ſelf, and take up my Croſs and follow him? Shall any of his Commandments ſeem grievous to me, after ſo many, ſo ſolemn profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love to him? God forbid that I ſhould caſt ſuch reproach upon him. I have

With what love ſhould we commemorate his dying love? with what deſire ſhould our ſouls approach to his holy Table in remembrance of him; who took ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in dying for us, and was ſo deſirous to inſtitute this holy feaſt, for a perpetual
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62913:174"/>
remembrance of his death? With the ſame joy that children uſe to welcome a Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; with ſuch an hunger and thirſt, as a labouring man goes to his ſupper; ought we to go to the Supper of the Lord: that we may chear and refreſh our ſouls with the memory of our Maſter and only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; with praiſes and joyful thankſgivings; with the love of God and of our Brethren; with the hopes of his Mercy here and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Awake, awake then thy Faith; call up thy love: quicken thy deſires: excite all that is within thee to bleſs the Lord and ſpeak good of his name. Say with a great joy, Lo, I come, according to thy command: and delight to do thy will, O God. With deſire I have deſired to do this in remembrance of my Lord: to declare thy mighty acts, and ſhew forth the greatneſs of thy love; to profeſs my ſelf thy ſervant, and to glory in the holy name of my Maſter Jeſus; to offer up my ſelf unto thee, an oblation of love; to renew my covenant with thee, and with all my Brethren; to give thee thanks that I am one of thy family, and for all the benefits I received, and thou haſt ſtill in ſtore for thy faithful ſervants. But who is able to tell how much he hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for us? Or find out all that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62913:174"/>
unto us? Who can praiſe him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his excellent kindneſs, and his wonderful works for the children of men? The thoughts of Angels are not wide enough to comprehend them. And if we had their ſpirits, and could love him and acknowledg him, with their inlarged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it would be too little a preſent to make unto him. <hi>O give thanks therefore unto the Lord, for he is gracious, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> O give thanks unto him, who is ſo deſirous of us, ſuch narrow ſouls, ſuch little hearts, that can hold ſo little love unto him. Let us go to him, and deſire that he would inlarge them; or that he would fill them to the heighth with his love. Since he is content, if he may but lodg and dwell in our breaſts, and have the government of us in his hands: let us go and vow, that he ſhall poſſeſs us ſolely to himſelf; that no affection, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhall dwell in us, without his leave; and all be ordered by him juſt as he pleaſes. And let us ſhew him now, that we have prepared no leſs gift than our whole ſelves to be beſtowed on him: that we are very deſirous of the honour to be commanded by him, and to do him ſervice; and that if he will make us more deſirous, more reſolved and ſtedfaſt in theſe holy purpoſes,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62913:175"/>
we will never ceaſe to thank him in this manner as long as we live.</p>
                     <p>And approaching thus, with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, may we not hope that he will accept us, and receive us as his friends, and embrace us with real love, and incloſe us, as we deſire, unto himſelf? Nay, he will hold us faſt tied in the bonds and cords of his love: not to fetter and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon us; but to unlock and open our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hearts by the power of it, that they be inlarged into the true liberty of love to him and to all the world. We may hope at laſt, that it will become as unnatural to offend him, as it is to kill our ſelves, or kick againſt the bowels of a moſt indulgent parent: that obedience ſhall be our delight: that all good things on earth, which have been our hindrance, ſhall prove our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and provocation to an holy life: and that our watchfulneſs over our ſelves ſhall be ſo ſtrict and ſevere, that we ſhall not be eaſily ſurpriſed; but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worſhip him, by preſenting him with a ſpirit like his own, innocent, harmleſs, and delighting to do all good.</p>

                     <p>O Moſt mighty Lord, the high and holy one who poſſeſſeſt eternity: who dwelleſt in the pureſt light, and whoſe Majeſty is enthroned in the midſt of all the heavenly hoſt, who are continually celebrating the praiſes of thy name, which is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent throughout the world. The light of thy countenance, I believe, is better than life: and one day in thy courts better than a thouſand. If thou wilt graciouſly ſhine upon me, when I enter into thy gates to go unto thy Table; if thou wilt fill me with the joys of Faith and love and holy hope; I ſhall account that day the beginning of the eternal life, and remember as long as I live how gracious thou art. But I have little reaſon to expect to be ſo highly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thee, who have forgotten oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that reverence and fear that I owe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62913:176"/>
to thee my Creator; and that love and dutiful affection which I owe to my Redeemer; and been too diſobedient to many good motions of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace. I have thought ſo much how to pleaſe my ſelf, and ſo little of pleaſing thee; ſpent ſo much time in the affairs of my body, and ſo little in thoſe of my immortal ſoul, that I may rather ſink into dejection of ſpirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place of darkneſs, than hope to be lifted up toward heaven, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light of life. I am apt to think that if I knew thee as the Angels do, I ſhould be filled with their love, and readily diſpoſed to thy obedience, and ſpend my ſelf in thy endleſs praiſes: whereas now that thou haſt revealed thoſe things to us which the thoughts of Angels entred not into, and haſt ſent thy dear Son in our nature and not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But thy gracious pardon, O Lord of love, I hope will make me admire thee; and love thee exceedingly. Some ſmall taſt and ſavour of thine extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary kindneſs, will inkindle in me the moſt ardent affection towards thee. And it is already the hearty deſire and ſtudy of my ſoul, thou knoweſt, that I may love thee above all things; and that all my love may run into ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, free and chearful obedience to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of thy Commands. They are all holy, juſt and good: they are moſt lovely and gracious in mine eyes. I eſteem thy precepts about all things to be moſt equal, beneficial, and highly

conducing to the perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our natures: and chuſe moſt joyfully to ſubmit my ſelf to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority of ſuch tender love and good-will towards us. O pitty and pardon an humble ſuitor to thee, that his heart may ever be under the power of thy holy Commands; and being captivated from all things here below, may become a ſubject of thy love. I wait on thee for the power of thy holy Spirit now to come upon me, to fill me with thoughts, deſires and affections ſutable to the duty which I am about to render to thee. That when I think of thoſe ſins, which killed the Lord of life, I may vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently abhor and utterly renounce them. And when I think of thy love, it may wonderfully raiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt my heart to love thee, delight in thee, and gratefully acknowledg thee. And when I think of thy holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, my heart may humbly bow,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62913:177"/>
and gladly reſign it ſelf to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. And the dying of the Lord Jeſus ſet before my eyes, may make me an offering holy and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thee for ever.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible how oft I fall ſhort of my own deſires and reſolutions: and therefore again look up unto thee, with a humble Faith, for thy powerful preſence with me.

againſt the moſt importunate tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to enable me to quell and bring under the ſtrongeſt oppoſitions to thy divine will.

                     <p>IS there any need after all that thou haſt heard, and thought, and ſaid of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that I ſhould call upon thee, and bid thee love him? Need I entreat and earneſtly beſeech thee, my Soul, to preſerve the memory of his moſt obliging kindneſs; and exhort thee to go again and again, to praiſe him in this manner? Methinks, we may turn our thoughts and our ſpeech to him; thanking and admiring the exceſs of his love, that he will let us approach thus near unto him. It is his love that he will at all regard us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the love we offer to him. But it is a great marvel of his love, that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated us ſo often, and uſed ſo many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to us, and laid ſo many obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on us to love him. What are we, that he ſhould ſeek after us on this faſhion, who had a mind to loſe him? It is ſtrange that he will accommodate and addreſs himſelf to our very ſenſes, that our dull fleſh may not hinder us from loving him. Good Lord! that thy delight ſhould be with the Sons of men. Couldſt thou not live unleſs we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo? Canſt thou be at all the better
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62913:179"/>
for us? Have we been kind unto thee, ſince thou haſt done all this for us? Or do we uſe half ſo many entreaties to thee, to do us good; as thou haſt done to us, to be good to our ſelves? O be aſtoniſhed at the greatneſs of his mercy. Do but throughly affect thy heart with the heighth and depth of his love; and love will make more pathetical and moving exhortations to thee, than any thought can invent. I will leave thee under the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of thy love. Ceaſe to love him if thou canſt; if thou doſt but think of his love. But think withal, what an hopeleſs condition that Soul is in, which the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus cannot move and prevail withal to love him. And what may all thy Brethren expect from thee, who are partakers of the common Salvation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thy ſelf? Canſt thou find in thy heart to offend him, for whom Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Wilt thou not open thy bowels of compaſſion towards others, when thou ſtandeſt in ſo great need even of infinite mercies thy ſelf? Shall ſome ſmall differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between you, four thy heart; or blunt the edge of that affection, which is ſharpned by the Divine love to us, when we were ſtrangers and enemies to him by evil works? How canſt thou chuſe but be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62913:180"/>
ready to do good, and to forgive, even thoſe that have done evil to thee? <hi>To bleſs them that curſe thee,</hi>

                     <p>HOw long is it ſince thou thoughteſt of the beſt friend thou haſt in the whole world? And what were thy laſt thoughts of him? Didſt thou not a very little while ago long for his company; and wiſh the time would come wherein thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt again enjoy him? Didſt thou not count the days till that happy time, when he promiſed to return or to ſend unto thee? And ſuppoſe he be dead; with what paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doſt thou follow his memory? How art thou moved with the mention of his dear name? How glad to poſſeſs any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of him, though it be but his ſhadow? Or how oft doſt thou look upon the lively picture of him, which is drawn in thy own imagination? And doſt thou think it could fail to put thee in mind, of what he left thee in charge when he departed this world? Couldſt thou forget the legacies he left thee, or the inheritance he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to thee, as the heir of his love?</p>
                     <p>O how long then is it, my ſoul, ſince
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:62913:185"/>
Jeſus was in thy thoughts? Canſt thou not tell? Was there ever ſuch a Friend as he, that dyed to ſave thee? Can any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much to thy love, or merit of thee ſo kind a remembrance? Who is there that ever died for the ſake of his enemies? O how pretious, how dear, ſhould the Name of Jeſus be unto thee! with what joy ſhouldſt thou receive the news, that he is coming to viſit thee? How welcome muſt this invitation be from thy bleſſed Saviour, whom if thou loveſt thou canſt not but long to ſee? It is the voice of thy well-beloved, that calls unto thee, and ſaith; come and feaſt with me. Come, and ſee by theſe ſenſible ſigns, which I have left to repreſent me, how much my love hath made me ſuffer for thee. Behold the lively figure of my Body and Blood, which was broken and ſhed to redeem thee. I have cauſed it to be made on purpoſe, that thou mighteſt not forget me.</p>
                     <p>What doſt thou anſwer to him? Canſt thou ſay, thou haſt looked for this day? That thou thoughteſt it long, till thou mighteſt go to his houſe? or at leaſt waſt deſirous to go, and ſee him ſet forth crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thine eyes? Why? What good did the laſt ſight of him do thee? What
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62913:185"/>
pangs of love didſt thou feel in thy heart? what pleaſure, what joy in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his kindneſs? Did it call all his Commands to mind, and recommend them effectually to thy love? Did it ſtir thee up to do his will, and make thee more zealous ever ſince in working that which is pleaſing in his ſight? What didſt thou think of the inheritance he hath given thee? <hi>An inheritance incorruptible,</hi>

                           <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24.</note> and verily expect to <hi>receive the reward of this inheritance?</hi> How did that faith then work in thy heart? Did it give thee extreme content? Having hope to ſee him, did it make <hi>thee purifie thy ſelf,</hi>

                        <hi>even as he is pure?</hi> Go then now as a friend of his, and do the ſame again. Renew thy remembrance of him. Shew him the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief thou haſt in him: the love thou beareſt to his name and word: how reſolved thou art never to forget him: and how happy thou thinkeſt thy ſelf, in the portion he hath given thee in his grace and love. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to him, that his Commandments are dearer to thee than thy life: and that thou wilt ſooner part with it, than not perform his holy will in every thing. Vow to him again that thou wilt be true and faithful to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62913:186"/>
him. Embrace all thy Brethren there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with a kind affection, becauſe they are his friends and followers. Deſire that all the world ſhould know him and be acquainted with him; and that a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al memory of him may be preſerved, by doing this, as long as the Sun and Moon endure. And canſt thou do it without thoſe paſſions, which the thoughts of a Friend are wont to raiſe up in thy heart? None of them, ſure, will be abſent upon this occaſion. They will all attend thee in this holy action: and thou wilt feel the greateſt gratitude to thy Saviour, who hath done ſo much to deſerve thy love, which is ſo little worth to him.</p>
                     <p>Then thou wilt hear him, as good as, ſay unto thee, <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> All that I have is thine.

What reaſon haſt thou to doubt of the injoyment; if thou art my friend, by doing whatſoever I command thee? Do not friends partake in each others goods? My power which I have over all things in Heaven and earth

                     <p>O Moſt holy and eternal God; who art good and doſt good: the whole earth is full of thy goodneſs. Thy mercy reacheth unto the Heavens, and thy faithfulneſs unto the Clouds. Thou art great in power, wiſdom, and all other perfections: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly to be feared, honoured and loved by all underſtanding creatures. When I conſider how much thou haſt done for me, or how much I have often promiſed to do for thee; I am on both hands confounded and aſhamed in my own thoughts. Thou art my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, my Father, my Saviour, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and conſtant Benefactor: the God
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62913:187"/>
of my life, of my health, of all my preſent comforts and future hopes. I have promiſed often to be thy faithful ſervant, and thy dutiful child: to honour and glorifie thee both with body and ſoul, and all the good things thou haſt beſtowed on me. In my Baptiſm I was dedicated unto thee; and have many times confirmed that gift, and renewed my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to continue in thy obedience. In my promiſes, proteſtations and vows I have been very liberal: but how ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in performance, thou, who art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all my ways, knoweſt. And I my ſelf know ſo much of my negligence, that I may juſtly wonder, thou ſtill retaineſt me in thy family, and letteſt me enjoy the priviledg of thy children. Adored be thy great long ſuffering and patience, towards me and all mankind. Thanks be to the name of the Lord, who after our abuſe of ſo many bleſſings, hath added the gift
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62913:187"/>
of his dear Son, and ſent him to pay a ranſome for us. O the unconceivable greatneſs of that love, which hath ſo much befriended the moſt ungrateful enemies. I humbly mention the blood of his Croſs, as a ſufficient ſacrifice, oblation and ſatisfaction, not only for my ſins, but the ſins of the whole world. I lift up my hands unto thee in his name, to receive that gracious pardon, which he hath purchaſed for me: hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorough him, that thou wilt ſtill continue thy love unto me, who am ſtedfaſtly reſolved to love thee above all things. Far be it from me to think that the love of our Lord ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me in any rebellion againſt thee, or countenance my contempt of thy holy Laws. No, love me ſo much, good Lord, as to change my will, and renew my nature into thy own likeneſs; that I may be truly a friend of God. I wiſh for no greater happineſs, than to feel my ſoul at peace and friendſhip
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62913:188"/>
with thee, by an intire and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love to all righteouſneſs, goodneſs and truth. And I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his dying love; that with the heartieſt affection I may devote my ſelf wholly to thy love and ſervice. I do as unfeignedly deſire that all my ſins may die; as I am glad that Chriſt died to be a propitiation for them. And I as ſincerely offer up my ſelf, my underſtanding, my will, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and paſſions, and all that I have, unto thee; as I really believe that he offered up himſelf for me. O that the power of the holy Ghoſt may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me: and unite my thoughts and affections to make a moſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commemoration of his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Repreſent unto my mind moſt feelingly all that Jeſus hath done and endured for our ſake. Fix my mind and heart upon the ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, he hath obtained to me. That I may not only behold the outward fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62913:188"/>
of him: but receive thoſe pledges of his love, with the humbleſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with ſuch a lively faith, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement love, and ready ſubmiſſion of my will to him; that Chriſt Jeſus may be inwardly formed in me. I long for the happineſs of knowing aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I am a friend of his, by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting greatly in his Commandments, and truſting my ſelf and all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns intirely in his hands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting my ſelf in his love and good will toward me, and rejoycing in the Soveraign Dominion, power and glory which thou haſt given him; with moſt earneſt deſires that all the world may love and obey him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>WIth what unwillingneſs, are we wont to leave the company of a Friend in whom we delight? How doth the remembrance of him ſtick unto our mind? How often do we think of the kind words we heard from his mouth, and view the tokens he hath left with us of his love? Do we not uſe to caſt our eyes behind us when we go from him, and look after him as long as he is in ſight? Are we not glad to ſee but his back, when we cannot behold his face? O ſweet Jeſus (then ſhouldſt thou ſay to thy ſelf) who can be content to part with the thoughts of thee, when he ſees the love thou beareſt to us; and all the bleſſings thou imparteſt to thy friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? What heart can endure to loſe the ſight of ſuch happineſs; or ſuffer thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to die out of its mind? I ſhould look as far as heaven, rather than ſuffer thee to go out of my thoughts: and always be caſting mine eyes to thy dwelling place; that I may behold, at this diſtance, though never ſo little of thy moſt excellent glory.</p>

It makes me ſigh to think, that I muſt loſe this clear and lively ſight which I have of thee. And yet, as heavy as it is, I will not ceaſe to be often looking after my Saviour. What though I cannot always ſee him, ſo as I have now ſeen him in the ſanctuary; yet I will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him. And the darkeſt apprehenſions of his love and favour, ſhall ever be dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to me, than any object in this world. Bleſſed be his goodneſs, which hath given me ſuch pledges of it, as engage me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him. <hi>I will he ever mindful to keep the Covenant,</hi> I have made with him, <hi>and remember his Commandments to do them.</hi>

                     <p>WIth what wonder and admiration do we entertain thoſe things which are ſtrange and unuſual? The very news of them carries great numbers to ſee them; and the ſight of them fixes their eyes on them, as if they could never have enough of them. Behold here the wonder of wonders, which thou art called to ſee, and ſeed thine eyes and heart withal. God is come to dwell in Fleſh. This fleſh is made a ſacrifice for the ſins of the world. And he invites thee now to a Feaſt upon that Sacrifice; that thou mayeſt dwell in him and he in thee. O marvellous love! what eyes ever ſaw ſuch a ſight as the Son of God dying on a Croſs? The only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father bleeding as a malefactor? The glorious King of Heaven laying down his life freely for his own ſubjects: Rebels I ſhould have called them, and enemies to him? Where are all my thoughts? Where is my admiration? What is become of my love? Whither are all my deſires gone? It will be a new wonder if they do not all

Strange! that my thoughts ſhould be ſo heavy, and my affections ſo cold! that my hunger and thirſt ſhould be no more excited, at the very motion to go to the houſe of God, to make a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death! We think the Angels lead an happy life, in their bleſſed employment of giving continual Praiſes to God: why do I not go then with a more forward joy into the Courts of the Lord to <hi>do this</hi> in remembrance of Chriſt, which thoſe Heavenly creatures do not do?

draw thy heart from him, or in the leaſt abate thy devotion to him. Thou wilt look upon it as a baſe temptation and an unworthy offer; which is not only to be ſlighted and rejected, but hated and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thou wilt ſay, I am dead to ſin, I cannot live any longer therein. I have done with all your adulterate pleaſures. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is my joy, my life and my crown: what pleaſes him; pleaſes me. His love is a Law within my heart: and therefore I delight to do thy will, O God.</p>

                     <p>WHat amazing News is this! What an aſtoniſhing piece of love! That the King of Kings who needed nothing, and is able by his Omnipotent word to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand more Creatures into being (if he wanted any ſubjects) than we can think of while we live, ſhould ſend a kind Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of peace, to us vile worms, ſinful duſt and aſhes. To us who were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a gracious look from him, ſhould we have beſought his favour; to us that had highly affronted his Sovereign Authority and Sacred Laws, he hath diſpatched a glorious Meſſage, as if we were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſons, and ſo many little Gods. And had it not been too great an honour for us to think of, if he had ſent one of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervants in the Heavenly Court to viſit

Or if he had bidden an illuſtrious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim, to come and comfort, and chear us by his bright appearance, or one of the Cherubims to flye all over the Earth, and make proclamation in their ears, that the King of Heaven would be reconciled to his rebellious ſubjects; Would it not have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whole world with wonder, and made all mankind ſtand at a gaze, to ſee themſelves ſo highly favoured? O what a grace then was it, that God ſhould ſend his Son, his only begotten Son, the Prince and Sovereign Lord of all that Heavenly hoſt, upon this buſineſs of reconciliation? See, my Soul, that which aſtoniſhes not men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Angels themſelves, who procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the birth of this Prince of life, with the loudeſt ſhouts of joy, ſaying, <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi>

I cannot deny the debt wherein I ſtand engaged; though I have too often denyed to pay it. For thou haſt raiſed me out of the duſt; and preſerved me from returning thither again. Thou haſt richly loaden me with thy benefits; endued me with principles of wiſdom, righteouſneſs and goodneſs; made a world of good things to wait upon me and miniſter to

Accompany me, O God, by that mighty ſpirit, through which he was conceived, and offered

himſelf without ſpot unto thee: that I may have a lively conception of him and his holy Goſpel in my mind, and be made conformable to him in every thing, and offered up intirely ſoul and body, to be ordered and diſpoſed of as pleaſeth him. It is but juſt and reaſonable that his will, not mine, ſhould be done. And it is no leſs my happineſs than my duty, to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, who is the wiſdom of thee our God.

Give me the grace, good Lord, never to be weary of well-doing; to be juſt in all my dealings; faithful in my promiſes; mindful of my vows; upright in the diſcharge of my truſt; inoffenſive in word and deed, and an uſeful and

                     <p>IS not our heavenly Father very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that we ſhould love him? Would he elſe have appeared among us? Would he have manifeſted himſelf to us? Yea, manifeſted himſelf in our fleſh? And more than that, purchaſed us to himſelf by his own blood? O how dear hath he paid for our love? Love him, love him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he may not loſe the great price, wherewith we are bought. But what love do we bear him, if we be not like him? What are we the better that a Saviour is born to us, if he be not formed in us, and dwell not in our heart by faith? Was not this the end of his taking our Nature, that he might purifie it; and make us reverence our ſelves more, than to defile that which is ſo near of kin to the Son of God? O moſt wiſe goodneſs, which by becoming like to us, deſigned to make us like thy ſelf. I ſee the humility of the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who was born of a poor Virgin. I ſee his ſweetneſs, in accommodating himſelf to the vileſt of us, and taking on him the form of a ſervant. I ſee how little he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the riches and the dignities and the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62913:220"/>
pleaſures of this world. How contented he was in a mean condition; how obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his parents; how courteous to the meaneſt clients, who came to receive, not to give. I ſee how liberal he was of his favours, how unwearied in doing good, how patient in ſuffering any evil; how he loved righteouſneſs and hated iniquity; how dear the honeſt heart was to him, and how odious hypocriſie. I ſee how meek he was when he was affronted; how loth his enemies ſhould periſh; how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd either in the calumnies, or applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the world; How abſolutely reſigned to the will of God; and how deſirous to do him honour. O how often did he thank his heavenly Father? How many hours did he ſpend in prayer and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him? How joyfully did he ſuffer great pains to do great good? And at laſt laid down his life, full of hope in God to ſee a glorious reſurrection? Theſe are the beauties of Jeſus, which I admire. This is the Image of him, which I have vowed to carry always in my heart. This is the glory of humane nature: the honour and dignity to which I would be preferred. I deſire to be great in nothing but his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: to be rich only in contentedneſs, patience, and good works: to be glorified
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:62913:220"/>
in meekneſs, and ſweet condiſcention: to have the pleaſure only of pleaſing God, and my Brethren to their edification: to rejoyce that Gods will is done, though mine be croſſed.</p>
                     <p>And it is no ſmall joy to ſee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of this beauteous image drawn upon my heart. He that did not deſpiſe the Virgins womb, will not deſpiſe the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oblation I have made of my ſelf to him; nor that little likeneſs he ſees in me of himſelf. Doſt thou not ſee, my ſoul, what great things come from mean begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? How a poor Babe that lay in a manger, came to be the King of glory? Hope in God then, that thou ſhalt grow to a greater ſtature; and more exactly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy deareſt Saviour. He hath given thee aſſurance that he will not over-look thee, now that he ſits on the Throne of his glory. It is a Throne of grace too, unto which thou mayſt addreſs thy ſelf, and find grace to help in time of need. Do but let him ſee how much thou honoureſt him; how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious his memory is unto thee, how thou art in love with his purity; and he that was manifeſted in our fleſh will manifeſt himſelf in thee. He will adorn thee with all his graces; and make thee ſhine as a
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:62913:221"/>
light in the world; in humble charity, in meekneſs of wiſdom, in chearful patience, and devout obedience. Bleſſed be God for this hope. I have no cauſe to envy the greateſt perſons: No, not her that carried him in her womb, and then in her arms; if there had been nothing more. For though we are apt to ſay as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among the multitude did, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee,</hi>

What can there be more delightful to thoſe, who know what it is to believe in him and obey him? And in what ſhall we ſpend the reſt of this time wherein we commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his coming into the world?

Is it not to render our higheſt thanks and praiſe to the Father and the Son, for this ineſtimable love, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his bloud a ranſom for us; and then to offer up our ſelves wholly to his love? Is it not to renew our Baptiſmal Covenant, wherein we promiſed to forſake all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to lead a mortified life in all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will? To repreſent to God what his Son hath done for us, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to hope in him, for all the benefits of his paſſion? To receive encreaſe of power to overcome the world, and further teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his love, and ſtronger deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conſummation of it in Heavenly

bliſs? To unite our heart in Brotherly affection to all the faithful ſervants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and to rejoyce in the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt and his Saints? O bleſſed Jeſus, who can have hearts diſpoſed to do all this without thee? I come to thee therefore, that thou wilt repreſent thy ſelf moſt lively to me. If I could have ſeen thee hanging on the Croſs; or if thou wouldeſt appear to me as thou didſt to <hi>Saul;</hi> if the Heavens were opened, and I could behold thee, as did St. <hi>Steven;</hi> what ſtrange paſſions, what holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would it raiſe up in my heart! Open thine eyes, my Soul, heartily and ſtrongly believe; and thy joy ſhall be full.

                     <p>WHat haſt thou now received from our Lord? Are they not the moſt ſacred pledges of his love? And what doth the Lord require of thee? but only love. But how great a thing is love? Love brought him down hither to us: and love will carry us up to God. Love made him like to man: and love is able to make thee like to God. O the power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly love! How ſhall we get it plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our heart? How? But by love? The frequent meditation of this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love of God in his Son Jeſus, will not ſuffer us not to love him with all our heart and ſoul and ſtrength. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve then that the remembrance of his love ſhall lie perpetually in our heart.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:62913:229"/>
As we have begun the year with the thoughts of his love: ſo let us continue it. What more welcome thought can there be to thee every morning when thou awakeſt than this, I am the beloved of the King of Glory? With what canſt thou open thy ſoul more chearfully? What will brighten it, and chaſe away the darkneſs of melancholly, ſorrow, ſadneſs, cares and fears, like to this? If thou haſt not loſt an hour, and waſted this pretious time which thou haſt ſpent at the Table of the Lord, thou canſt not but feel the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty force of his infinite love. Let us try, my ſoul, what it will be able to do in a whole years thoughts upon it. Let the morning light bring Jeſus ever along with it to thy mind: and enkindle in thee a new devotion to him. And let us take all occaſions to celebrate his memory; that ſo our holy reſolutions may be more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtrengthned; and when the flame begins to burn dimm, we may blow it up again, and add more fewel to it. If a friend had left thee a token of his love, whereby to keep him in mind, wouldſt thou throw it into ſome blind corner, and never look upon it? But ſuppoſe he was a dying friend, nay a friend that dyed for thee, to ſave thee from death; could he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62913:229"/>
ever go out of thy mind, or wouldſt thou let the thing he left to remember him by, be long out of thine eye? Let us not deal more unkindly with our Saviour. Did he think when he went to heaven, that thoſe whom he hath ſo obliged, would remember his love ſo ſeldom and ſo coldly? That they need be ſo much entreated to come and have communion with him? Is it not a grief to him now (if he be capable of any) to ſee that he hath ſo few lovers? And that they who profeſs love to him, teſtifie it ſo rarely and in ſo poor a manner? Let us vow, my ſoul, again that we will henceforth ſhew our ſelves his hearty friends, by keeping his holy Commands: and never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that this is one, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> I will remember thee, O Lord, and in this manner lift up my hands in thy name; till I have finiſhed my dayes and come to ſee thee as thou art, in all thy Majeſty and Glory.</p>

                     <p>O Moſt mighty Lord of heaven and earth, the Father of Spirits, the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: whoſe name is ever hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an innumerable company of Holy ones, that are always burning with love to thee, and praiſing thy moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perfections; thy incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſdom, goodneſs, righteouſneſs and truth. The Sun ſhineth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the brightneſs of thy Majeſty. The Angels are unclean, in compare

with the purity of thy holineſs. What are we, O Lord, that thou wilt look down from the habitation of thy holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon us! what manner of love is this, wherewith thou haſt loved us! in ſending thy Son down among us, and deſigning to take us up unto thy ſelf, that we may joyn with that holy fellowſhip of Angels and Saints, to love and praiſe thee for ever. We are the off-ſpring of rebellious parents, that have been tranſgreſſors from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Who have diſhonoured our nature, deſpiſed or undervalued thy grace in the Lord Jeſus, reſiſted or coldly entertained thy holy Spirit; and loved theſe little things here below, more than that eternal happineſs, which Jeſus hath revealed by his reſurrection from the dead. We are not worthy of the crumbs that fall from thy Table, which thou haſt ſpread for all creatures, or of the leaſt drop of thy mercies. We are not worthy to lick the duſt before
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:62913:235"/>
thee; becauſe we deſerve not to live and breath any longer in this world. And yet thou letteſt us live in hope, that we ſhall live with thee: and thou giveſt us leave to breath forth our ſouls towards thee: and haſt thy ſelf ſpread a new Table for us, and furniſhed it with the richeſt of thy bleſſings: and inviteſt me moſt graciouſly, among the reſt, to come now and feaſt with thee, and eat of the bread of life which came down from heaven, and is able to nouriſh me to eternal life. I would fain, O Lord, approach into thy holy preſence there, and behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thy love. But I am covered with ſhame and bluſhing becauſe of my ingratitude unto thee. I cannot with any confidence open my eyes towards thee, till I have ſome ſenſe in my heart that thou art willing to cover my ſins, and hide thy face from mine iniquities. Which I cannot reaſonably hope for, till I find them loathſome, grievous

                     <p>O Moſt mighty Lord, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth: who art every where and canſt not be excluded from any place, no not from the cloſeſt thoughts of any of our hearts. Who art always the ſame, and canſt no more change, than thou canſt ceaſe to be what thou art: unmoveably fixed in thy own eternal bleſſedneſs. Thou needeſt not go out of thy ſelf for any thing; and I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I cannot poſſibly make thee greater, or more happy than thou art: But it is my bounden duty to admire and extol, to laud and praiſe, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, love and honour thee: and <hi>it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and praiſe is comely.</hi> All the Hoſt of Heaven delight to ſing perpetual Hymns, to the glory of thy infinite Majeſty: with whom I beſeech thee to give me leave
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:62913:240"/>
to joyn my poor and imperfect praiſes. The whole world was made out of Nothing by thy Power: and proclaims thy greatneſs, wiſdom and goodneſs in the multitude, variety, beauty, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and order of all thy works of wonder. The Heavens are the work of thy hands; the Earth ſtands faſt by thy appointment, and every thing keeps the courſe wherein thou haſt ſet it with admirable conſtancy. Thou governeſt all things without any trouble: becauſe at once thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and canſt do what thou pleaſeſt; and thou doſt all things with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon, juſtice, mercy and pleaſure to thy ſelf. Man was raiſed by thee out of the duſt of Earth; and thou didſt inſpire him with a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Spirit; and placedſt him in a Paradiſe ſurrounded with thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and Lord over the work of thy hands. And when he had degraded himſelf, and forfeited, by his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62913:241"/>
his garden of pleaſure; thou didſt not leave him without a remedy, but openedſt the way for him into the Paradiſe above. Thou didſt ſend thy holy Prophets, and meſſengers in all ages to thy people; and in the fulneſs of time, thine own dear Son, the brightneſs of thy glory: whom thou haſt made Heir of all things, and to whom thou haſt graciouſly committed the care of us. Bleſſed be thy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſs, who haſt made him in all things like unto us, ſin only excepted, ſo that we know and are ſure, that he will take care of us, and pity us, and relieve us. I adore thy unparalell'd love in giving him to die, that he might make expiation for our ſins; and that he hath overcome death by his riſing again; and is ſet down at thy right hand, becauſe he was obedient to the death. From thence we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the gift of the Holy Ghoſt (thanks be to thy Grace) to confirm us in the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62913:241"/>
belief of his Reſurrection, and of all his promiſes, by ſigns and wonders, and mighty deeds; and to give us power to perform our duty towards thee and towards all men. Thou haſt ſpread this Goſpel of Salvation into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt parts of the Earth; and the light of it hath long ſhone upon this Kingdom where I live. I was born into this light, as well as into the light of the Sun, and had early aſſurances given me of thy love. In my very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy I was devoted to thee; and all the engagements I was capable of, laid upon me to be happy, by being a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſciple of Chriſt Jeſus. Thou haſt not failed ſince to breath on me by thy Holy Spirit, and to move me to my duty; that I might be able to make <hi>the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 21.</note> and ſo be <hi>ſaved by his his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Many happy opportunities haſt thou put into my hands, to improve my ſelf in Chriſtian wiſdom and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62913:242"/>
and engaged me to thee in many ſolemn vows, only to ſeek the glory, honour, and immortality, which Chriſt hath brought to light, by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent continuance in well-doing. I have now received the pledges of it, and commemorated his love in dying for us, and thy love in raiſing him to life again: that he might perfect our Salvation; and aſſure us he hath obtained an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption; and comfort us againſt the fears of death; and take care of us for ever; and receive the power and glory thou promiſedſt him, that he may be able to bleſs us and do us all good. O how hath thy love abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt Jeſus! Beſides a world of outward bleſſings, which thy bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand hath poured on me, and ſtill continues merely out of thy goodneſs and liberality.
